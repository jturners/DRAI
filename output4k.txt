warnings and cautions: The content discusses the warnings and precautions associated with the use of the drug gabapentin. It highlights potential risks such as drug reactions, anaphylaxis, angioedema, driving impairment, increased seizure frequency, suicidal behavior, respiratory depression, and neuropsychiatric adverse reactions. 

Gabapentin can cause serious reactions like DRESS (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms), which can be fatal. Symptoms include fever, rash, and organ system involvement. If such symptoms occur, gabapentin should be discontinued. 

Anaphylaxis and angioedema can occur at any time during treatment. If patients experience difficulty breathing, swelling of lips, throat, and tongue, they should discontinue the drug and seek immediate medical care. 

Gabapentin can impair driving and operating heavy machinery. Patients should not drive until they have gained sufficient experience to assess whether their ability is impaired. 

Abrupt discontinuation of gabapentin in patients with seizure disorders may increase seizure frequency. 

The drug can also increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. Patients should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts, or unusual changes in mood or behavior. 

Respiratory depression may occur when gabapentin is used with other CNS depressants or in patients with underlying respiratory impairment. 

In children aged 3 to 12, gabapentin can cause CNS related adverse reactions such as emotional lability, hostility, thought disorder, and hyperkinesia. 

The drug has also been associated with an increased incidence of pancreatic acinar cell tumors in rats, but the clinical significance of this finding is unknown. 

Finally, during the premarketing development of gabapentin, 8 sudden and unexplained deaths were recorded among a cohort of 2203 epilepsy patients treated with gabapentin. 
adverse reactions: The document discusses the adverse reactions associated with a drug, with specific sections dedicated to serious reactions, common reactions, and reactions observed in clinical trials. Serious reactions include Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), Anaphylaxis and Angioedema, Somnolence/Sedation and Dizziness, Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus, Suicidal Behavior and Ideation, Respiratory Depression, Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions in pediatric patients, and Sudden and Unexplained Death in Patients with Epilepsy. 

Common reactions include dizziness, somnolence, peripheral edema, ataxia, fatigue, nystagmus, viral infection, fever, nausea, vomiting, and hostility.

pregnancy: A pregnancy exposure registry monitors the outcomes of pregnancies in women who have taken antiepileptic drugs like gabapentin. Women taking gabapentin during pregnancy are encouraged to register with the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. There is insufficient data on the developmental risks of using gabapentin during pregnancy. Nonclinical studies on animals have shown developmental toxicity when gabapentin was administered to pregnant animals at doses similar to or lower than those used in humans. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the general population is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% respectively, but the risk for those taking gabapentin is unknown. Animal studies have shown embryofetal toxicity in mice, adverse effects on offspring development in rats, and increased embryofetal mortality in rabbits when given gabapentin during pregnancy. A study also showed that gabapentin caused a significant decrease in neuronal synapse formation in mice brains, but the clinical significance of these findings is unknown. 
nursing mothers: 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Gabapentin is secreted in human milk following oral administration. The effects on the breastfed infant and on milk production are unknown. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for gabapentin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from gabapentin or from the underlying maternal condition. 
information for patients: The patient counseling information advises patients to read the FDA-approved labeling guide. Gabapentin, the medication in question, can be taken orally with or without food. Before starting treatment, patients should be aware that symptoms such as rash, fever, or lymphadenopathy could indicate a serious medical event. If patients experience signs of anaphylaxis or angioedema, they should stop taking gabapentin and seek medical help. 

Gabapentin may cause dizziness, somnolence, and other symptoms of CNS depression, which can be exacerbated by other sedative drugs. Patients should avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until they understand how gabapentin affects them. The duration of this effect is unknown. 

Patients should also be aware that gabapentin may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. They should monitor for symptoms of depression, mood changes, or suicidal thoughts and report any concerns to their healthcare provider. 

Gabapentin can cause respiratory depression, especially in those using other CNS depressants or those with underlying respiratory issues. Patients should be taught to recognize signs of respiratory depression and seek immediate medical attention if it occurs. 

If patients become pregnant or plan to breastfeed during treatment, they should inform their physician. They are also encouraged to enroll in the NAAED Pregnancy Registry, which collects information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy.

substance name: AMPICILLIN SODIUM 
indications and usage: Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is used to treat infections caused by susceptible strains of certain microorganisms. It is effective against skin and skin structure infections, intra-abdominal infections, and gynecological infections caused by beta-lactamase producing strains of various bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Bacteroides fragilis, Enterobacter spp., and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. 

The drug can also treat infections caused by ampicillin-susceptible organisms due to its ampicillin content. Therefore, mixed infections caused by both ampicillin-susceptible and beta-lactamase producing organisms should not require additional antibacterial treatment. 

Before treatment, appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed to identify the organisms causing infection and their susceptibility to the drug. Therapy may be started before obtaining these results if there is reason to believe the infection may involve any of the beta-lactamase producing organisms listed above. 

The drug should only be used to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria to prevent the development of drug-resistant bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. 
dosage and administration: Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection, USP can be administered via IV or IM routes. For IV, the dose can be given slowly over 10-15 minutes or as an infusion over 15-30 minutes. For IM, it should be a deep injection. The recommended adult dosage is 1.5 g to 3 g every six hours, with the total sulbactam dose not exceeding 4 grams per day. For pediatric patients aged 1 year or older, the recommended daily dose is 300 mg per kg of body weight, administered via IV infusion every 6 hours. However, the safety of IM injection in pediatric patients is not established. Pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or more should follow adult dosage recommendations. IV therapy should not exceed 14 days. In patients with impaired renal function, the elimination kinetics of both drugs are similarly affected, so the ratio remains constant. The dosage in such patients should be administered less frequently. The dosage guide for patients with renal impairment is based on creatinine clearance and ranges from 1.5 g to 3 g every 6 to 24 hours. If only serum creatinine is available, a formula based on sex, weight, and age can be used to convert this value into creatinine clearance. 
contraindications: CONTRAINDICATIONS The use of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is contraindicated in individuals with a history of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis or Stevens-Johnson syndrome) to ampicillin, sulbactam or to other beta-lactam antibacterial drugs (e.g., penicillins and cephalosporins). Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is contraindicated in patients with a previous history of cholestatic jaundice/hepatic dysfunction associated with ampicillin and sulbactam for injection. 
adverse reactions: Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is generally well tolerated in adults and children, but some adverse reactions have been reported. Local reactions include pain at the injection site and thrombophlebitis. Systemic reactions include diarrhea, rash, itching, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, headache, chest pain, and other less common symptoms. In children, atypical lymphocytosis has been observed. Adverse laboratory changes include increased liver enzymes, changes in blood cell counts, decreased serum albumin and total proteins, increased BUN and creatinine, and presence of RBC's and hyaline casts in urine. Post-marketing experience has identified additional adverse reactions including blood and lymphatic system disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, general disorders, immune system disorders, nervous system disorders, renal and urinary disorders, respiratory disorders, and skin disorders. These reactions are usually reversible upon discontinuation of therapy. Serious and fatal hypersensitivity reactions may occur. To report suspected adverse reactions, contact Meitheal Pharmaceuticals or the FDA. 
pregnancy: Pregnancy Reproduction studies have been performed in mice, rats, and rabbits at doses up to ten (10) times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to ampicillin and sulbactam for injection. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed (see -PRECAUTIONS-Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions section). 
nursing mothers: Nursing Mothers Low concentrations of ampicillin and sulbactam are excreted in the milk; therefore, caution should be exercised when ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is administered to a nursing woman. 
precautions: Ampicillin and sulbactam are antibacterials that should not be given to patients with mononucleosis due to the high risk of skin rash. During treatment, the possibility of superinfections with mycotic or bacterial pathogens should be considered. If superinfections occur, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy started. The drug should only be prescribed for bacterial infections, not viral ones, and patients should complete the full course of therapy to prevent bacterial resistance. Diarrhea is a common side effect, and if patients develop watery and bloody stools, they should contact their physician immediately.

Drug interactions include probenecid, which can increase blood levels of ampicillin and sulbactam, and allopurinol, which can increase the incidence of rashes. Ampicillin and sulbactam should not be mixed with aminoglycosides due to inactivation. High urine concentrations of ampicillin can result in false positive reactions when testing for glucose in urine.

In pregnant women, ampicillin can cause a transient decrease in plasma concentration of certain hormones. Animal studies have not shown evidence of harm to the fetus, but there are no adequate studies in pregnant women. The drug should only be used during pregnancy if necessary. The effect of the drug on labor and delivery is unknown. Low concentrations of the drug are excreted in breast milk, so caution is advised when administering to nursing women.

The safety and effectiveness of the drug have been established for pediatric patients one year and older for skin and skin structure infections. However, its safety and effectiveness have not been established for intra-abdominal infections in pediatric patients. 
storage and handling: Storage Conditions Prior to reconstitution store at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F); excursions permitted between 15° and 30°C (59° and 86°F).

Gujarat, India 390010 Revised: January 2023 
information for patients: Patients should be informed that drugs like ampicillin and sulbactam are used to treat bacterial infections, not viral ones like the common cold. Even if they start feeling better early in the treatment, they should follow the prescribed dosage and complete the full course to prevent the bacteria from developing resistance. Skipping doses can reduce the treatment's effectiveness and make the bacteria untreatable by this or other antibacterial drugs. Antibacterials can cause diarrhea, which usually stops once the medication is discontinued. However, patients can develop watery and bloody stools, sometimes with stomach cramps and fever, even months after the last dose. If this happens, they should contact their doctor immediately.

The drug should only be used to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria to prevent the development of drug-resistant bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. 
dosage and administration: Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection, USP can be administered via IV or IM routes. For IV, the dose can be given slowly over 10-15 minutes or as an infusion over 15-30 minutes. For IM, it should be a deep injection. The recommended adult dosage is 1.5 g to 3 g every six hours, with the total sulbactam dose not exceeding 4 grams per day. For pediatric patients aged 1 year or older, the recommended daily dose is 300 mg per kg of body weight, administered via IV infusion every 6 hours. However, the safety of IM injection in pediatric patients is not established. Pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or more should follow adult dosage recommendations. IV therapy should not exceed 14 days. In patients with impaired renal function, the elimination kinetics of both drugs are similarly affected, so the ratio remains constant. The dosage in such patients should be administered less frequently. The dosage guide for patients with renal impairment is based on creatinine clearance and ranges from 1.5 g to 3 g every 6 to 24 hours. If only serum creatinine is available, a formula based on sex, weight, and age can be used to convert this value into creatinine clearance. 
contraindications: CONTRAINDICATIONS The use of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is contraindicated in individuals with a history of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis or Stevens-Johnson syndrome) to ampicillin, sulbactam or to other beta-lactam antibacterial drugs (e.g., penicillins and cephalosporins). Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is contraindicated in patients with a previous history of cholestatic jaundice/hepatic dysfunction associated with ampicillin and sulbactam for injection. 
adverse reactions: Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is generally well tolerated in adults and children, but some adverse reactions have been reported. Local reactions include pain at the injection site and thrombophlebitis. Systemic reactions include diarrhea, rash, itching, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, headache, chest pain, and other less common symptoms. In children, atypical lymphocytosis has been observed. Adverse laboratory changes include increased liver enzymes, changes in blood cell counts, decreased serum albumin and total proteins, increased BUN and creatinine, and presence of RBC's and hyaline casts in urine. Post-marketing experience has identified additional adverse reactions including blood and lymphatic system disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, general disorders, immune system disorders, nervous system disorders, renal and urinary disorders, respiratory disorders, and skin disorders. These reactions are usually reversible upon discontinuation of therapy. Serious and fatal hypersensitivity reactions may occur. To report suspected adverse reactions, contact Meitheal Pharmaceuticals or the FDA. 
pregnancy: Pregnancy Reproduction studies have been performed in mice, rats, and rabbits at doses up to ten (10) times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to ampicillin and sulbactam for injection. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed (see -PRECAUTIONS-Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions section). 
nursing mothers: Nursing Mothers Low concentrations of ampicillin and sulbactam are excreted in the milk; therefore, caution should be exercised when ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is administered to a nursing woman. 
precautions: Ampicillin and sulbactam are antibacterials that should not be given to patients with mononucleosis due to the high risk of skin rash. During treatment, the possibility of superinfections with mycotic or bacterial pathogens should be considered. If superinfections occur, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy started. The drug should only be prescribed for bacterial infections, not viral ones, and patients should complete the full course of therapy to prevent bacterial resistance. Diarrhea is a common side effect, and if patients develop watery and bloody stools, they should contact their physician immediately.

Drug interactions include probenecid, which can increase blood levels of ampicillin and sulbactam, and allopurinol, which can increase the incidence of rashes. Ampicillin and sulbactam should not be mixed with aminoglycosides due to inactivation. High urine concentrations of ampicillin can result in false positive reactions when testing for glucose in urine.

In pregnant women, ampicillin can cause a transient decrease in plasma concentration of certain hormones. Animal studies have not shown evidence of harm to the fetus, but there are no adequate studies in pregnant women. The drug should only be used during pregnancy if necessary. The effect of the drug on labor and delivery is unknown. Low concentrations of the drug are excreted in breast milk, so caution is advised when administering to nursing women.

The safety and effectiveness of the drug have been established for pediatric patients one year and older for skin and skin structure infections. However, its safety and effectiveness have not been established for intra-abdominal infections in pediatric patients.

information for patients: Patients should be informed that drugs like ampicillin and sulbactam are used to treat bacterial infections, not viral ones like the common cold. Even if they start feeling better early in the treatment, they should follow the prescribed dosage and complete the full course to prevent the bacteria from developing resistance. Skipping doses can reduce the treatment's effectiveness and make the bacteria untreatable by this or other antibacterial drugs. Antibacterials can cause diarrhea, which usually stops once the medication is discontinued. However, patients can develop watery and bloody stools, sometimes with stomach cramps and fever, even months after the last dose. If this happens, they should contact their doctor immediately.
