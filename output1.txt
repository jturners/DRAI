8. Tumorigenic Potential: Gabapentin increased the incidence of pancreatic acinar cell tumors in rats, but the clinical significance of this finding is unknown.
9. Sudden and Unexplained Death in Patients with Epilepsy: There were 8 sudden and unexplained deaths recorded among a cohort of 2203 epilepsy patients treated with gabapentin during premarketing development. 
adverse reactions: The document discusses the adverse reactions associated with a drug, with specific sections detailing reactions in different age groups and conditions. Serious reactions include Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), Anaphylaxis, Angioedema, Somnolence/Sedation, Dizziness, Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus, Suicidal Behavior and Ideation, Respiratory Depression, Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions, and Sudden and Unexplained Death in Patients with Epilepsy. 

Common reactions include dizziness, somnolence, peripheral edema, ataxia, fatigue, nystagmus, viral infection, fever, nausea, vomiting, and hostility. Adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in some cases. 

The document also provides information on how to report suspected adverse reactions and discusses the limitations of clinical trials in predicting adverse reaction rates in the general population. 

Postherpetic neuralgia and epilepsy patients experienced different adverse reactions. In postherpetic neuralgia patients, the most common reactions were dizziness, somnolence, and peripheral edema. In epilepsy patients, reactions varied by age. 

Adverse reactions were also reported postmarketing, including hepatobiliary disorders, elevated creatine kinase, elevated liver function tests, hyponatremia, rhabdomyolysis, movement disorder, psychiatric disorders, reproductive system and breast disorders, and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. Life-threatening or fatal respiratory depression has been reported in patients taking the drug with opioids or other CNS depressants, or in those with underlying respiratory impairment. Abrupt discontinuation of the drug has also been associated with adverse reactions. 
pregnancy: A pregnancy exposure registry monitors the outcomes of pregnancies in women who have taken antiepileptic drugs like gabapentin. Women taking gabapentin during pregnancy are encouraged to register with the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. There is insufficient data on the developmental risks of using gabapentin during pregnancy. Nonclinical studies on animals have shown developmental toxicity when gabapentin was administered to pregnant animals. In the general U.S. population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% respectively. The risk for the population indicated is unknown. Animal data shows embryofetal toxicity in mice and adverse effects on offspring development in rats when given gabapentin during pregnancy. Increased embryofetal mortality was observed in rabbits. A study showed that gabapentin caused a significant decrease in neuronal synapse formation in mice. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. 
nursing mothers: 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Gabapentin is secreted in human milk following oral administration. The effects on the breastfed infant and on milk production are unknown. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for gabapentin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from gabapentin or from the underlying maternal condition. 
information for patients: This is patient counseling information for the drug gabapentin. Patients should be aware that:

1. Gabapentin can be taken orally with or without food.
2. Before starting gabapentin, patients should be informed that a rash or other signs of hypersensitivity could indicate a serious medical event. They should report any such symptoms to a doctor immediately.

substance name: AMPICILLIN SODIUM 
indications and usage: Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is a treatment for infections caused by certain microorganisms. It is effective against skin and skin structure infections, intra-abdominal infections, and gynecological infections caused by beta-lactamase producing strains of various bacteria. The drug should be used only for the conditions listed, and is also effective against infections caused by ampicillin-susceptible organisms. Before treatment, appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed to identify the organisms causing infection. Therapy may be started before these results are obtained if there is reason to believe the infection may involve any of the listed organisms. Once results are known, therapy should be adjusted if necessary. The drug should only be used to treat infections proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria, to prevent the development of drug-resistant bacteria. If culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered when choosing or modifying therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may guide the selection of therapy. 
dosage and administration: Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection, USP can be administered via IV or IM routes. For IV, the dose can be given slowly over 10-15 minutes or as an infusion over 15-30 minutes. For IM, it should be a deep injection. The recommended adult dosage is 1.5 g to 3 g every six hours, with the total dose of sulbactam not exceeding 4 grams per day. For pediatric patients aged 1 year or older, the recommended daily dose is 300 mg per kg of body weight, given every 6 hours. However, the safety of IM administration in pediatric patients is not established. Pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or more should follow adult dosage recommendations. IV therapy should not exceed 14 days. In patients with impaired renal function, the dosage should be adjusted according to the degree of impairment. The dosage guide is provided in the content for different levels of creatinine clearance. 
contraindications: CONTRAINDICATIONS The use of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is contraindicated in individuals with a history of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis or Stevens-Johnson syndrome) to ampicillin, sulbactam or to other beta-lactam antibacterial drugs (e.g., penicillins and cephalosporins). Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is contraindicated in patients with a previous history of cholestatic jaundice/hepatic dysfunction associated with ampicillin and sulbactam for injection. 
adverse reactions: The injection of Ampicillin and Sulbactam is generally well tolerated in adults. However, some adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials. Local reactions include pain at the injection site and thrombophlebitis. Systemic reactions include diarrhea, rash, itching, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, headache, chest pain, and other less common symptoms. 

In pediatric patients, the adverse events profile is similar to adults, with the addition of atypical lymphocytosis observed in one case. 

Adverse laboratory changes reported during clinical trials include increased liver enzymes, changes in blood cell counts, decreased serum albumin and total proteins, increased BUN and creatinine, and presence of RBC's and hyaline casts in urine. 

Post-marketing experiences have reported additional adverse reactions including blood and lymphatic system disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, general disorders, immune system disorders, nervous system disorders, renal and urinary disorders, respiratory disorders, and skin disorders. 

These reactions are usually reversible upon discontinuation of therapy. Serious and fatal hypersensitivity reactions may occur. To report suspected adverse reactions, contact Meitheal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. or FDA. 
pregnancy: Pregnancy Reproduction studies have been performed in mice, rats, and rabbits at doses up to ten (10) times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to ampicillin and sulbactam for injection. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed (see -PRECAUTIONS-Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions section). 
nursing mothers: Nursing Mothers Low concentrations of ampicillin and sulbactam are excreted in the milk; therefore, caution should be exercised when ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is administered to a nursing woman. 
precautions: Patients with mononucleosis should not be given ampicillin class antibacterials due to the high risk of developing a skin rash. Ampicillin and sulbactam should only be prescribed for bacterial infections, not viral ones, and patients should complete the full course of therapy to prevent bacterial resistance. Diarrhea is a common side effect, and patients should contact their doctor if they develop watery and bloody stools. The drug may interact with probenecid and allopurinol, potentially leading to increased blood levels of ampicillin and sulbactam and an increased incidence of rashes. It should not be mixed with aminoglycosides. High urine concentrations of ampicillin may cause false positive reactions in glucose tests. The drug may also temporarily decrease plasma concentration of certain hormones in pregnant women. Its effects on fertility and during labor and delivery are not fully known. It is excreted in low concentrations in breast milk. The safety and effectiveness of the drug have been established for children over one year old for skin infections, but not for intra-abdominal infections. 
storage and handling: Storage Conditions Prior to reconstitution store at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F); excursions permitted between 15° and 30°C (59° and 86°F).

information for patients: Patients should be aware that antibiotics like ampicillin and sulbactam are only effective against bacterial infections, not viral ones like the common cold. Even if they start feeling better, patients should complete the full course of the medication as prescribed to prevent the bacteria from developing resistance. Side effects like diarrhea are common and usually stop once the medication is discontinued. However, if patients experience watery and bloody stools, with or without stomach cramps and fever, even months after the last dose, they should contact their doctor immediately.

Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed (see -PRECAUTIONS-Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions section). 
nursing mothers: Nursing Mothers Low concentrations of ampicillin and sulbactam are excreted in the milk; therefore, caution should be exercised when ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is administered to a nursing woman. 
precautions: Patients with mononucleosis should not be given ampicillin class antibacterials due to the high risk of developing a skin rash. Ampicillin and sulbactam should only be prescribed for bacterial infections, not viral ones, and patients should complete the full course of therapy to prevent bacterial resistance. Diarrhea is a common side effect, and patients should contact their doctor if they develop watery and bloody stools. The drug may interact with probenecid and allopurinol, potentially leading to increased blood levels of ampicillin and sulbactam and an increased incidence of rashes. It should not be mixed with aminoglycosides. High urine concentrations of ampicillin may cause false positive reactions in glucose tests. The drug may also temporarily decrease plasma concentration of certain hormones in pregnant women. Its effects on fertility and during labor and delivery are not fully known. It is excreted in low concentrations in breast milk. The safety and effectiveness of the drug have been established for children over one year old for skin infections, but not for intra-abdominal infections. 
storage and handling: Storage Conditions Prior to reconstitution store at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F); excursions permitted between 15° and 30°C (59° and 86°F).

Capsules: 100 mg, 300 mg, and 400 mg (3) 
contraindications: 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Gabapentin is contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the drug or its ingredients. Known hypersensitivity to gabapentin or its ingredients 
warnings and cautions: The document provides warnings and precautions for the use of the drug gabapentin. It highlights potential risks such as:

1. Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS): Gabapentin should be discontinued if an alternative cause for the symptoms cannot be established.
2. Anaphylaxis and Angioedema: If these occur, gabapentin should be discontinued and the patient should seek immediate medical care.
3. Driving Impairment; Somnolence/Sedation and Dizziness: Patients should not drive or operate heavy machinery until they have assessed whether gabapentin impairs their ability.
4. Increased seizure frequency: This may occur if gabapentin is abruptly discontinued in patients with seizure disorders.
5. Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Patients should be monitored for suicidal thoughts/behavior.
6. Respiratory Depression: This may occur when gabapentin is used with other central nervous system depressants or in patients with underlying respiratory impairment.
7. Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions in Children 3 to 12 Years of Age: Children should be monitored for such events.
8. Tumorigenic Potential: Gabapentin increased the incidence of pancreatic acinar cell tumors in rats, but the clinical significance of this finding is unknown.
9. Sudden and Unexplained Death in Patients with Epilepsy: There were 8 sudden and unexplained deaths recorded among a cohort of 2203 epilepsy patients treated with gabapentin during premarketing development. 
adverse reactions: The document discusses the adverse reactions associated with a drug, with specific sections detailing reactions in different age groups and conditions. Serious reactions include Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), Anaphylaxis, Angioedema, Somnolence/Sedation, Dizziness, Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus, Suicidal Behavior and Ideation, Respiratory Depression, Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions, and Sudden and Unexplained Death in Patients with Epilepsy. 

Common reactions include dizziness, somnolence, peripheral edema, ataxia, fatigue, nystagmus, viral infection, fever, nausea, vomiting, and hostility. Adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in some cases. 

The document also provides information on how to report suspected adverse reactions and discusses the limitations of clinical trials in predicting adverse reaction rates in the general population. 

Postherpetic neuralgia and epilepsy patients experienced different adverse reactions. In postherpetic neuralgia patients, the most common reactions were dizziness, somnolence, and peripheral edema. In epilepsy patients, reactions varied by age. 

Adverse reactions were also reported postmarketing, including hepatobiliary disorders, elevated creatine kinase, elevated liver function tests, hyponatremia, rhabdomyolysis, movement disorder, psychiatric disorders, reproductive system and breast disorders, and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. Life-threatening or fatal respiratory depression has been reported in patients taking the drug with opioids or other CNS depressants, or in those with underlying respiratory impairment. Abrupt discontinuation of the drug has also been associated with adverse reactions. 
pregnancy: A pregnancy exposure registry monitors the outcomes of pregnancies in women who have taken antiepileptic drugs like gabapentin. Women taking gabapentin during pregnancy are encouraged to register with the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. There is insufficient data on the developmental risks of using gabapentin during pregnancy. Nonclinical studies on animals have shown developmental toxicity when gabapentin was administered to pregnant animals. In the general U.S. population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% respectively. The risk for the population indicated is unknown. Animal data shows embryofetal toxicity in mice and adverse effects on offspring development in rats when given gabapentin during pregnancy. Increased embryofetal mortality was observed in rabbits. A study showed that gabapentin caused a significant decrease in neuronal synapse formation in mice. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. 
nursing mothers: 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Gabapentin is secreted in human milk following oral administration. The effects on the breastfed infant and on milk production are unknown. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for gabapentin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from gabapentin or from the underlying maternal condition. 
information for patients: This is patient counseling information for the drug gabapentin. Patients should be aware that:

1. Gabapentin can be taken orally with or without food.
2. Before starting gabapentin, patients should be informed that a rash or other signs of hypersensitivity could indicate a serious medical event. They should report any such symptoms to a doctor immediately.
3. If patients develop signs of anaphylaxis or angioedema, they should stop taking gabapentin and seek medical care.
4. Gabapentin may cause dizziness, somnolence, and other symptoms of CNS depression. Patients should avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until they know how gabapentin affects them.
5. Gabapentin, like other AEDs, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Patients should be alert for worsening depression, changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts.
6. Gabapentin may cause respiratory depression, especially in those using other CNS depressants or those with underlying respiratory impairment. Patients should seek medical attention immediately if this occurs.
7. If patients become pregnant or plan to breastfeed, they should inform their doctor. They are also encouraged to enroll in the NAAED Pregnancy Registry, which collects information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy.

substance name: AMPICILLIN SODIUM 
indications and usage: Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is a treatment for infections caused by certain microorganisms. It is effective against skin and skin structure infections, intra-abdominal infections, and gynecological infections caused by beta-lactamase producing strains of various bacteria. The drug should be used only for the conditions listed, and is also effective against infections caused by ampicillin-susceptible organisms. Before treatment, appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed to identify the organisms causing infection. Therapy may be started before these results are obtained if there is reason to believe the infection may involve any of the listed organisms. Once results are known, therapy should be adjusted if necessary. The drug should only be used to treat infections proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria, to prevent the development of drug-resistant bacteria. If culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered when choosing or modifying therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may guide the selection of therapy. 
dosage and administration: Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection, USP can be administered via IV or IM routes. For IV, the dose can be given slowly over 10-15 minutes or as an infusion over 15-30 minutes. For IM, it should be a deep injection. The recommended adult dosage is 1.5 g to 3 g every six hours, with the total dose of sulbactam not exceeding 4 grams per day. For pediatric patients aged 1 year or older, the recommended daily dose is 300 mg per kg of body weight, given every 6 hours. However, the safety of IM administration in pediatric patients is not established. Pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or more should follow adult dosage recommendations. IV therapy should not exceed 14 days. In patients with impaired renal function, the dosage should be adjusted according to the degree of impairment. The dosage guide is provided in the content for different levels of creatinine clearance. 
contraindications: CONTRAINDICATIONS The use of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is contraindicated in individuals with a history of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis or Stevens-Johnson syndrome) to ampicillin, sulbactam or to other beta-lactam antibacterial drugs (e.g., penicillins and cephalosporins). Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is contraindicated in patients with a previous history of cholestatic jaundice/hepatic dysfunction associated with ampicillin and sulbactam for injection. 
adverse reactions: The injection of Ampicillin and Sulbactam is generally well tolerated in adults. However, some adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials. Local reactions include pain at the injection site and thrombophlebitis. Systemic reactions include diarrhea, rash, itching, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, headache, chest pain, and other less common symptoms. 

In pediatric patients, the adverse events profile is similar to adults, with the addition of atypical lymphocytosis observed in one case. 

Adverse laboratory changes reported during clinical trials include increased liver enzymes, changes in blood cell counts, decreased serum albumin and total proteins, increased BUN and creatinine, and presence of RBC's and hyaline casts in urine. 

Post-marketing experiences have reported additional adverse reactions including blood and lymphatic system disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, general disorders, immune system disorders, nervous system disorders, renal and urinary disorders, respiratory disorders, and skin disorders. 

These reactions are usually reversible upon discontinuation of therapy. Serious and fatal hypersensitivity reactions may occur. To report suspected adverse reactions, contact Meitheal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. or FDA. 
pregnancy: Pregnancy Reproduction studies have been performed in mice, rats, and rabbits at doses up to ten (10) times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to ampicillin and sulbactam for injection.

substance name: DIVALPROEX SODIUM 
indications and usage: Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablet is an anti-epileptic drug used for treating manic episodes related to bipolar disorder, complex partial seizures, simple and complex absence seizures, and for preventing migraine headaches. It is not recommended for acute treatment of migraines. The drug's effectiveness for long-term use in mania has not been proven in controlled clinical trials, so healthcare providers should regularly reassess its usefulness for individual patients. Due to the risk of decreased IQ, neurodevelopmental disorders, neural tube defects, and other major congenital malformations in the fetus, it should not be used by pregnant women or women planning to become pregnant, unless other medications have failed to control symptoms or are unacceptable. It is also contraindicated in women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception. 
dosage and administration: Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets are taken orally and should not be crushed or chewed. The initial dose for mania is 750 mg daily, which can be increased to achieve the desired therapeutic response. For complex partial seizures, the starting dose is 10 to 15 mg/kg/day, which can be increased weekly until optimal response is achieved. For absence seizures, the starting dose is 15 mg/kg/day, which can be increased weekly until seizures are controlled or side effects limit further increases. For migraines, the starting dose is 250 mg twice daily, which can be increased to a maximum of 1,000 mg/day as needed. 

If a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible unless it's almost time for the next dose. Doubling the next dose if one is skipped is not recommended. 

For long-term treatment of mania, there is no data to support the benefits of divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets. However, the safety of long-term use is supported by data from record reviews involving approximately 360 patients treated for more than 3 months. 

For epilepsy, divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets are indicated as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in complex partial seizures in adults and pediatric patients down to the age of 10 years, and in simple and complex absence seizures. 

For elderly patients, the starting dose should be reduced due to a decrease in unbound clearance of valproate and possibly a greater sensitivity to somnolence. The ultimate therapeutic dose should be achieved on the basis of both tolerability and clinical response. 

Patients who experience G.I. irritation may benefit from administration of the drug with food or by slowly building up the dose from an initial low level. 

Patients stabilized on rufinamide before being prescribed valproate should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to a clinically effective dose. 
dosage forms and strengths: 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Tablets: 125 mg, 250 mg and 500 mg ( 3 ) Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets, 125 mg are pink colored, oval shaped, biconvex, enteric coated tablets, imprinted with "L005" (in black ink) on one side and plain on the other side. Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets, 250 mg are pink colored, oval shaped, biconvex, enteric coated tablets, imprinted with "L006" (in black ink) on one side and plain on the other side. Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets, 500 mg are pink colored, oval shaped, biconvex, enteric coated tablets, imprinted with "L007" (in black ink) on one side and plain on the other side. 
contraindications: The use of Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets is contraindicated in the following cases:

1. Patients with hepatic disease or significant hepatic dysfunction.
2. Patients with known mitochondrial disorders caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ (POLG), such as Alpers-Huttenlocher Syndrome.
3. Children under two years of age suspected of having a POLG-related disorder.
4. Patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug.
5. Patients with known urea cycle disorders.
6. For the prevention of migraine headaches, the drug is contraindicated in pregnant women and women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception. 
warnings and cautions: The content provided is a detailed list of warnings and precautions for the use of Divalproex Sodium, a medication used to treat certain types of seizures and manic episodes related to bipolar disorder. 

Key points include:

1. Hepatotoxicity: The drug can cause liver damage. Regular monitoring of liver function is necessary, especially in high-risk populations.

2. Birth defects and neurodevelopmental disorders: The drug should not be used in pregnant women or women planning to become pregnant due to the risk of birth defects and decreased IQ in children exposed to the drug in utero.

3. Pancreatitis: The drug can cause pancreatitis and should be discontinued if this occurs.

4. Suicidal behavior or ideation: The drug can increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior.

5. Bleeding and other hematopoietic disorders: Regular monitoring of platelet counts and coagulation tests is necessary.

6. Hyperammonemia and hyperammonemic encephalopathy: The drug can cause high ammonia levels in the blood, leading to lethargy, vomiting, or changes in mental status.

7. Hypothermia: The drug can cause a drop in body temperature.

8. Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan hypersensitivity reaction: The drug can cause a severe allergic reaction affecting multiple organs.

9. Somnolence in the elderly: The drug can cause drowsiness in elderly patients, and dosage should be increased slowly with regular monitoring.

10. Interaction with Carbapenem Antibiotics: These antibiotics can reduce the effectiveness of the drug, leading to loss of seizure control.

11. Effect on HIV and CMV Viruses Replication: The drug may stimulate the replication of HIV and CMV viruses under certain conditions.

12. Medication Residue in the Stool: There have been rare reports of medication residue in the stool, particularly in patients with shortened GI transit times or diarrhea. 

In all cases, regular monitoring and consultation with a healthcare provider is necessary. 
adverse reactions: The document discusses the adverse reactions to a drug called valproate, used in the treatment of manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder, complex partial seizures, and migraines. The most common side effects (reported in more than 5% of patients) include abdominal pain, blurred vision, memory loss, anorexia, back pain, constipation, depression, diarrhea, dizziness, fever, headache, increased appetite, insomnia, nausea, nervousness, rash, vomiting, weight gain, and weight loss. 

The safety and tolerability of valproate in pediatric patients were found to be similar to those in adults. Serious adverse reactions include hepatic failure, birth defects, decreased IQ following in utero exposure, pancreatitis, hyperammonemic encephalopathy, suicidal behavior and ideation, bleeding and other hematopoietic disorders, hypothermia, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)/multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions. 

In clinical trials, the rates of premature termination due to intolerance were not statistically different between placebo, valproate, and lithium carbonate. Vomiting was the only reaction that was reported by significantly more patients receiving valproate compared to placebo. 

Postmarketing experience has identified additional adverse reactions including changes in hair texture and color, emotional upset, psychosis, aggression, fractures, decreased bone mineral density, irregular menses, weight gain, hearing loss, and allergic reactions. 
pregnancy: The content discusses the risks associated with the use of the antiepileptic drug, divalproex sodium, during pregnancy. There is a registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to this drug. Pregnant women are encouraged to enroll in this registry. 

The drug is contraindicated for use in pregnant women and women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception, especially for the prophylaxis of migraine headaches. For epilepsy or bipolar disorder, it should only be used if other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control. 

The use of this drug during pregnancy increases the risk of congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects, and other body system malformations. It may also result in hearing impairment or hearing loss in the baby. The risk of major structural abnormalities is greatest during the first trimester. 

Children exposed to this drug in utero have lower IQ scores and a higher risk of neurodevelopmental disorders compared to children exposed to either another antiepileptic drug in utero or to no antiepileptic drugs in utero. 

Pregnant women taking this drug may develop hepatic failure or clotting abnormalities, which may result in hemorrhagic complications in the neonate, including death. 

Folic acid supplementation prior to conception and during the first trimester of pregnancy is recommended for patients using this drug, although it is not known whether this reduces the risk of neural tube defects or decreased IQ in the offspring. 

The use of this drug during pregnancy should be carefully considered and monitored due to the associated risks. 
nursing mothers: 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception while taking valproate [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 ), and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . This is especially important when valproate use is considered for a condition not usually associated with permanent injury or death such as prophylaxis of migraine headaches [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Infertility There have been reports of male infertility coincident with valproate therapy [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.4 )] . In animal studies, oral administration of valproate at clinically relevant doses resulted in adverse reproductive effects in males [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 
information for patients: This is a patient counseling information guide for a medication called valproate. It advises patients to be aware of potential side effects such as hepatotoxicity and pancreatitis, which can cause symptoms like nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and anorexia. It also warns of the risk of birth defects and decreased IQ in children if the drug is used during pregnancy. Women are advised to use effective contraception while taking valproate and to discuss pregnancy planning with their doctor. 

The guide also warns of the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior, hyperammonemic encephalopathy, CNS depression, and multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions. Patients are advised to report any concerning symptoms to their healthcare provider immediately. 

The medication may cause drowsiness, especially when combined with other CNS depressants like alcohol, so patients are advised not to engage in hazardous activities until they know how the drug affects them. 

Patients are also advised to report if they notice medication residue in their stool. The medication is manufactured by Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Lupin Limited.

1. Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS): Gabapentin should be discontinued if an alternative cause for the symptoms cannot be established.
2. Anaphylaxis and Angioedema: If these occur, gabapentin should be discontinued and the patient should seek immediate medical care.
3. Driving Impairment; Somnolence/Sedation and Dizziness: Patients should not drive or operate heavy machinery until they have assessed whether gabapentin impairs their ability.
4. Increased seizure frequency: This may occur if gabapentin is abruptly discontinued in patients with seizure disorders.
5. Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Patients should be monitored for suicidal thoughts/behavior.
6. Respiratory Depression: This may occur when gabapentin is used with other central nervous system depressants or in patients with underlying respiratory impairment.
7. Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions in Children 3 to 12 Years of Age: Children should be monitored for such events.
8. Tumorigenic Potential: Gabapentin increased the incidence of pancreatic acinar cell tumors in rats, but the clinical significance of this finding is unknown.
9. Sudden and Unexplained Death in Patients with Epilepsy: There were 8 sudden and unexplained deaths recorded among a cohort of 2203 epilepsy patients treated with gabapentin during premarketing development. 
adverse reactions: The document discusses the adverse reactions associated with a drug, with specific sections detailing reactions in different age groups and conditions. Serious reactions include Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), Anaphylaxis, Angioedema, Somnolence/Sedation, Dizziness, Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus, Suicidal Behavior and Ideation, Respiratory Depression, Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions, and Sudden and Unexplained Death in Patients with Epilepsy. 

Common reactions include dizziness, somnolence, peripheral edema, ataxia, fatigue, nystagmus, viral infection, fever, nausea, vomiting, and hostility. Adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in some cases. 

The document also provides information on how to report suspected adverse reactions and discusses the limitations of clinical trials in predicting adverse reaction rates in the general population. 

Postherpetic neuralgia and epilepsy patients experienced different adverse reactions. In postherpetic neuralgia patients, the most common reactions were dizziness, somnolence, and peripheral edema. In epilepsy patients, reactions varied by age. 

Adverse reactions were also reported postmarketing, including hepatobiliary disorders, elevated creatine kinase, elevated liver function tests, hyponatremia, rhabdomyolysis, movement disorder, psychiatric disorders, reproductive system and breast disorders, and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. Life-threatening or fatal respiratory depression has been reported in patients taking the drug with opioids or other CNS depressants, or in those with underlying respiratory impairment. Abrupt discontinuation of the drug has also been associated with adverse reactions. 
pregnancy: A pregnancy exposure registry monitors the outcomes of pregnancies in women who have taken antiepileptic drugs like gabapentin. Women taking gabapentin during pregnancy are encouraged to register with the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. There is insufficient data on the developmental risks of using gabapentin during pregnancy. Nonclinical studies on animals have shown developmental toxicity when gabapentin was administered to pregnant animals. In the general U.S. population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% respectively. The risk for the population indicated is unknown. Animal data shows embryofetal toxicity in mice and adverse effects on offspring development in rats when given gabapentin during pregnancy. Increased embryofetal mortality was observed in rabbits. A study showed that gabapentin caused a significant decrease in neuronal synapse formation in mice. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. 
nursing mothers: 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Gabapentin is secreted in human milk following oral administration. The effects on the breastfed infant and on milk production are unknown. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for gabapentin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from gabapentin or from the underlying maternal condition. 
information for patients: This is patient counseling information for the drug gabapentin. Patients should be aware that:

1. Gabapentin can be taken orally with or without food.
2. Before starting gabapentin, patients should be informed that a rash or other signs of hypersensitivity could indicate a serious medical event. They should report any such symptoms to a doctor immediately.
3. If patients develop signs of anaphylaxis or angioedema, they should stop taking gabapentin and seek medical care.
4. Gabapentin may cause dizziness, somnolence, and other symptoms of CNS depression. Patients should avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until they know how gabapentin affects them.
5. Gabapentin, like other AEDs, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Patients should be alert for worsening depression, changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts.
6. Gabapentin may cause respiratory depression, especially in those using other CNS depressants or those with underlying respiratory impairment. Patients should seek medical attention immediately if this occurs.
7. If patients become pregnant or plan to breastfeed, they should inform their doctor. They are also encouraged to enroll in the NAAED Pregnancy Registry, which collects information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy.

substance name: AMPICILLIN SODIUM 
indications and usage: Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is a treatment for infections caused by certain microorganisms. It is effective against skin and skin structure infections, intra-abdominal infections, and gynecological infections caused by beta-lactamase producing strains of various bacteria. The drug should be used only for the conditions listed, and is also effective against infections caused by ampicillin-susceptible organisms. Before treatment, appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed to identify the organisms causing infection. Therapy may be started before these results are obtained if there is reason to believe the infection may involve any of the listed organisms. Once results are known, therapy should be adjusted if necessary. The drug should only be used to treat infections proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria, to prevent the development of drug-resistant bacteria. If culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered when choosing or modifying therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may guide the selection of therapy. 
dosage and administration: Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection, USP can be administered via IV or IM routes. For IV, the dose can be given slowly over 10-15 minutes or as an infusion over 15-30 minutes. For IM, it should be a deep injection. The recommended adult dosage is 1.5 g to 3 g every six hours, with the total dose of sulbactam not exceeding 4 grams per day. For pediatric patients aged 1 year or older, the recommended daily dose is 300 mg per kg of body weight, given every 6 hours. However, the safety of IM administration in pediatric patients is not established. Pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or more should follow adult dosage recommendations. IV therapy should not exceed 14 days. In patients with impaired renal function, the dosage should be adjusted according to the degree of impairment. The dosage guide is provided in the content for different levels of creatinine clearance. 
contraindications: CONTRAINDICATIONS The use of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is contraindicated in individuals with a history of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis or Stevens-Johnson syndrome) to ampicillin, sulbactam or to other beta-lactam antibacterial drugs (e.g., penicillins and cephalosporins). Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is contraindicated in patients with a previous history of cholestatic jaundice/hepatic dysfunction associated with ampicillin and sulbactam for injection. 
adverse reactions: The injection of Ampicillin and Sulbactam is generally well tolerated in adults. However, some adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials. Local reactions include pain at the injection site and thrombophlebitis. Systemic reactions include diarrhea, rash, itching, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, headache, chest pain, and other less common symptoms. 

In pediatric patients, the adverse events profile is similar to adults, with the addition of atypical lymphocytosis observed in one case. 

Adverse laboratory changes reported during clinical trials include increased liver enzymes, changes in blood cell counts, decreased serum albumin and total proteins, increased BUN and creatinine, and presence of RBC's and hyaline casts in urine. 

Post-marketing experiences have reported additional adverse reactions including blood and lymphatic system disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, general disorders, immune system disorders, nervous system disorders, renal and urinary disorders, respiratory disorders, and skin disorders. 

These reactions are usually reversible upon discontinuation of therapy. Serious and fatal hypersensitivity reactions may occur. To report suspected adverse reactions, contact Meitheal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. or FDA. 
pregnancy: Pregnancy Reproduction studies have been performed in mice, rats, and rabbits at doses up to ten (10) times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to ampicillin and sulbactam for injection. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed (see -PRECAUTIONS-Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions section). 
nursing mothers: Nursing Mothers Low concentrations of ampicillin and sulbactam are excreted in the milk; therefore, caution should be exercised when ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is administered to a nursing woman. 
precautions: Patients with mononucleosis should not be given ampicillin class antibacterials due to the high risk of developing a skin rash. Ampicillin and sulbactam should only be prescribed for bacterial infections, not viral ones, and patients should complete the full course of therapy to prevent bacterial resistance. Diarrhea is a common side effect, and patients should contact their doctor if they develop watery and bloody stools. The drug may interact with probenecid and allopurinol, potentially leading to increased blood levels of ampicillin and sulbactam and an increased incidence of rashes. It should not be mixed with aminoglycosides. High urine concentrations of ampicillin may cause false positive reactions in glucose tests. The drug may also temporarily decrease plasma concentration of certain hormones in pregnant women. Its effects on fertility and during labor and delivery are not fully known. It is excreted in low concentrations in breast milk. The safety and effectiveness of the drug have been established for children over one year old for skin infections, but not for intra-abdominal infections. 
storage and handling: Storage Conditions Prior to reconstitution store at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F); excursions permitted between 15° and 30°C (59° and 86°F).

substance name: DIVALPROEX SODIUM 
indications and usage: Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablet is an anti-epileptic drug used for treating manic episodes related to bipolar disorder, complex partial seizures, simple and complex absence seizures, and for preventing migraine headaches. It is not recommended for acute treatment of migraines. The drug's effectiveness for long-term use in mania has not been proven in controlled clinical trials, so healthcare providers should regularly reassess its usefulness for individual patients. Due to the risk of decreased IQ, neurodevelopmental disorders, neural tube defects, and other major congenital malformations in the fetus, it should not be used by pregnant women or women planning to become pregnant, unless other medications have failed to control symptoms or are unacceptable. It is also contraindicated in women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception. 
dosage and administration: Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets are taken orally and should not be crushed or chewed. The initial dose for mania is 750 mg daily, which can be increased to achieve the desired therapeutic response. For complex partial seizures, the starting dose is 10 to 15 mg/kg/day, which can be increased weekly until optimal response is achieved. For absence seizures, the starting dose is 15 mg/kg/day, which can be increased weekly until seizures are controlled or side effects limit further increases. For migraines, the starting dose is 250 mg twice daily, which can be increased to a maximum of 1,000 mg/day as needed. 

If a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible unless it's almost time for the next dose. Doubling the next dose if one is skipped is not recommended. 

For long-term treatment of mania, there is no data to support the benefits of divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets. However, the safety of long-term use is supported by data from record reviews involving approximately 360 patients treated for more than 3 months. 

For epilepsy, divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets are indicated as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in complex partial seizures in adults and pediatric patients down to the age of 10 years, and in simple and complex absence seizures. 

For elderly patients, the starting dose should be reduced due to a decrease in unbound clearance of valproate and possibly a greater sensitivity to somnolence. The ultimate therapeutic dose should be achieved on the basis of both tolerability and clinical response. 

Patients who experience G.I. irritation may benefit from administration of the drug with food or by slowly building up the dose from an initial low level. 

Patients stabilized on rufinamide before being prescribed valproate should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to a clinically effective dose. 
dosage forms and strengths: 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Tablets: 125 mg, 250 mg and 500 mg ( 3 ) Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets, 125 mg are pink colored, oval shaped, biconvex, enteric coated tablets, imprinted with "L005" (in black ink) on one side and plain on the other side. Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets, 250 mg are pink colored, oval shaped, biconvex, enteric coated tablets, imprinted with "L006" (in black ink) on one side and plain on the other side. Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets, 500 mg are pink colored, oval shaped, biconvex, enteric coated tablets, imprinted with "L007" (in black ink) on one side and plain on the other side. 
contraindications: The use of Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets is contraindicated in the following cases:

1. Patients with hepatic disease or significant hepatic dysfunction.

4. Patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug.
5. Patients with known urea cycle disorders.
6. For the prevention of migraine headaches, the drug is contraindicated in pregnant women and women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception. 
warnings and cautions: The content provided is a detailed list of warnings and precautions for the use of Divalproex Sodium, a medication used to treat certain types of seizures and manic episodes related to bipolar disorder. 

Key points include:

1. Hepatotoxicity: The drug can cause liver damage. Regular monitoring of liver function is necessary, especially in high-risk populations.

2. Birth defects and neurodevelopmental disorders: The drug should not be used in pregnant women or women planning to become pregnant due to the risk of birth defects and decreased IQ in children exposed to the drug in utero.

3. Pancreatitis: The drug can cause pancreatitis and should be discontinued if this occurs.

4. Suicidal behavior or ideation: The drug can increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior.

5. Bleeding and other hematopoietic disorders: Regular monitoring of platelet counts and coagulation tests is necessary.

6. Hyperammonemia and hyperammonemic encephalopathy: The drug can cause high ammonia levels in the blood, leading to lethargy, vomiting, or changes in mental status.

7. Hypothermia: The drug can cause a drop in body temperature.

8. Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan hypersensitivity reaction: The drug can cause a severe allergic reaction affecting multiple organs.

9. Somnolence in the elderly: The drug can cause drowsiness in elderly patients, and dosage should be increased slowly with regular monitoring.

10. Interaction with Carbapenem Antibiotics: These antibiotics can reduce the effectiveness of the drug, leading to loss of seizure control.

11. Effect on HIV and CMV Viruses Replication: The drug may stimulate the replication of HIV and CMV viruses under certain conditions.

12. Medication Residue in the Stool: There have been rare reports of medication residue in the stool, particularly in patients with shortened GI transit times or diarrhea. 

In all cases, regular monitoring and consultation with a healthcare provider is necessary. 
adverse reactions: The document discusses the adverse reactions to a drug called valproate, used in the treatment of manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder, complex partial seizures, and migraines. The most common side effects (reported in more than 5% of patients) include abdominal pain, blurred vision, memory loss, anorexia, back pain, constipation, depression, diarrhea, dizziness, fever, headache, increased appetite, insomnia, nausea, nervousness, rash, vomiting, weight gain, and weight loss. 

The safety and tolerability of valproate in pediatric patients were found to be similar to those in adults. Serious adverse reactions include hepatic failure, birth defects, decreased IQ following in utero exposure, pancreatitis, hyperammonemic encephalopathy, suicidal behavior and ideation, bleeding and other hematopoietic disorders, hypothermia, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)/multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions. 

In clinical trials, the rates of premature termination due to intolerance were not statistically different between placebo, valproate, and lithium carbonate. Vomiting was the only reaction that was reported by significantly more patients receiving valproate compared to placebo. 

Postmarketing experience has identified additional adverse reactions including changes in hair texture and color, emotional upset, psychosis, aggression, fractures, decreased bone mineral density, irregular menses, weight gain, hearing loss, and allergic reactions. 
pregnancy: The content discusses the risks associated with the use of the antiepileptic drug, divalproex sodium, during pregnancy. There is a registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to this drug. Pregnant women are encouraged to enroll in this registry. 

The drug is contraindicated for use in pregnant women and women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception, especially for the prophylaxis of migraine headaches. For epilepsy or bipolar disorder, it should only be used if other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control. 

The use of this drug during pregnancy increases the risk of congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects, and other body system malformations. It may also result in hearing impairment or hearing loss in the baby. The risk of major structural abnormalities is greatest during the first trimester. 

Children exposed to this drug in utero have lower IQ scores and a higher risk of neurodevelopmental disorders compared to children exposed to either another antiepileptic drug in utero or to no antiepileptic drugs in utero. 

Pregnant women taking this drug may develop hepatic failure or clotting abnormalities, which may result in hemorrhagic complications in the neonate, including death. 

Folic acid supplementation prior to conception and during the first trimester of pregnancy is recommended for patients using this drug, although it is not known whether this reduces the risk of neural tube defects or decreased IQ in the offspring. 

The use of this drug during pregnancy should be carefully considered and monitored due to the associated risks. 
nursing mothers: 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception while taking valproate [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 ), and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . This is especially important when valproate use is considered for a condition not usually associated with permanent injury or death such as prophylaxis of migraine headaches [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Infertility There have been reports of male infertility coincident with valproate therapy [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.4 )] . In animal studies, oral administration of valproate at clinically relevant doses resulted in adverse reproductive effects in males [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 
information for patients: This is a patient counseling information guide for a medication called valproate. It advises patients to be aware of potential side effects such as hepatotoxicity and pancreatitis, which can cause symptoms like nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and anorexia. It also warns of the risk of birth defects and decreased IQ in children if the drug is used during pregnancy. Women are advised to use effective contraception while taking valproate and to discuss pregnancy planning with their doctor. 

The guide also warns of the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior, hyperammonemic encephalopathy, CNS depression, and multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions. Patients are advised to report any concerning symptoms to their healthcare provider immediately. 

The medication may cause drowsiness, especially when combined with other CNS depressants like alcohol, so patients are advised not to engage in hazardous activities until they know how the drug affects them. 

Patients are also advised to report if they notice medication residue in their stool. The medication is manufactured by Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Lupin Limited. 
substance name: ALPRAZOLAM 
indications and usage: 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Alprazolam tablets are indicated for the: • acute treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in adults. • treatment of panic disorder (PD), with or without agoraphobia in adults. Alprazolam tablets are a benzodiazepine indicated for the: • Acute treatment of generalized anxiety disorder in adults. ( 1 ) • Treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults. ( 1 ) 
dosage and administration: The document provides dosage and administration guidelines for alprazolam, a medication used to treat generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and panic disorder (PD). 

For GAD, the starting dosage is 0.25 mg to 0.5 mg three times daily, which can be increased every 3 to 4 days to a maximum of 4 mg daily. The lowest effective dose should be used and the need for continued treatment should be frequently assessed.

For PD, the starting dosage is 0.5 mg three times daily, which can be increased every 3 to 4 days by no more than 1 mg per day. For patients receiving doses greater than 4 mg per day, periodic reassessment and consideration of dosage reduction is advised.

When tapering off alprazolam, the dosage should be decreased by no more than 0.5 mg every 3 days. If withdrawal reactions occur, the taper may need to be paused or the dosage increased to the previous level, then decreased more slowly.

For geriatric patients and those with hepatic impairment, the starting dosage is 0.25 mg, given 2 or 3 times daily, which can be gradually increased if needed and tolerated. If adverse reactions occur, the dosage may be reduced.

When alprazolam is used with ritonavir, the dosage should be reduced to half of the recommended dosage and then increased to the target dose after 10 to 14 days. Alprazolam is contraindicated with concomitant use of all strong CYP3A inhibitors, except ritonavir. 
dosage forms and strengths: 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Alprazolam tablets are available as: • 0.25 mg: white, oval, debossed “GG 256” on one side and scored on the reverse side • 0.5 mg: peach, oval, debossed “GG 257” on one side and scored on the reverse side • 1 mg: blue, oval, debossed “GG 258” on one side and scored on the reverse side • 2 mg: white, rectangular, multi-scored, debossed “GG 249” on one side and plain on the reverse side Tablets: 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, and 2 mg ( 3 ) 
contraindications: 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Alprazolam is contraindicated in patients: • with known hypersensitivity to alprazolam or other benzodiazepines. Angioedema has been reported [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . • taking strong cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole), except ritonavir [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] • Known hypersensitivity to alprazolam or other benzodiazepines. ( 4 ) • Concomitant use with strong cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) inhibitors, except ritonavir. ( 4 , 5.5 , 7.1 ) 
warnings and cautions: The content provides warnings and precautions for the use of alprazolam, a medication often used to treat anxiety and panic disorders. Key points include:

1. Alprazolam can impair driving and operating machinery. Patients should avoid alcohol and other central nervous system depressants while on this medication.
2. Patients with depression should be closely monitored while on alprazolam. The least number of tablets should be prescribed to avoid intentional overdosage.
3. Alprazolam use during pregnancy can lead to neonatal sedation and withdrawal syndrome.
4. The combined use of alprazolam and opioids can lead to severe sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and even death. If these drugs are prescribed together, the lowest effective dosages should be used.
5. Alprazolam can lead to abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can result in overdose or death. Patients should be assessed for these risks before and during treatment.
6. Discontinuing alprazolam abruptly or reducing the dosage rapidly can lead to withdrawal reactions, some of which can be life-threatening.
7. Alprazolam can interact with drugs that inhibit its metabolism, potentially affecting its clearance from the body.
8. Alprazolam may worsen depression and has been associated with episodes of hypomania and mania.
9. Late pregnancy use of alprazolam can result in neonatal sedation and withdrawal symptoms.
10. Patients with impaired respiratory function should be closely monitored while on alprazolam, as there have been reports of death in such patients shortly after starting the medication. 
adverse reactions: The document discusses the adverse reactions associated with the use of a drug, presumably alprazolam. These reactions are categorized into those identified during clinical trials and those reported post-approval. 

In clinical trials, common adverse reactions for generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder included impaired coordination, hypotension, dysarthria, and increased libido. Other reactions were also reported, such as drowsiness, light-headedness, dizziness, dry mouth, increased salivation, hypotension, dermatitis/allergy, and various other symptoms. 

In postmarketing experience, adverse reactions included hyperprolactinemia, peripheral edema, hepatitis, hepatic failure, liver enzyme elevations, hypomania, mania, gynecomastia, galactorrhea, photosensitivity reaction, angioedema, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. 

The document also mentions risks associated with concomitant use with opioids, abuse, misuse, addiction, dependence and withdrawal reactions, effects on driving and operating machinery, patients with depression, neonatal sedation and withdrawal syndrome, and risks in patients with impaired respiratory function. 

Adverse reactions were also reported as reasons for discontinuation of treatment, including insomnia, light-headedness, abnormal involuntary movement, headache, muscular twitching, impaired coordination, muscle tone disorders, weakness, and various other symptoms. 

The document advises that alprazolam should be discontinued if any of these adverse events occur. It also notes that patients with certain conditions, such as borderline personality disorder, a history of violent or aggressive behavior, or alcohol or substance abuse, may be at higher risk for adverse events. 
pregnancy: There is a registry that tracks pregnancy outcomes in women who have been exposed to psychiatric medications, including alprazolam. Healthcare providers are urged to register patients in this registry. Babies born to mothers who used benzodiazepines late in pregnancy may experience symptoms of sedation and/or withdrawal. However, available data does not clearly link benzodiazepines to major birth defects. All pregnancies carry a risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the general U.S. population, the estimated risk of major birth defects is 2% to 4% and miscarriage is 15% to 20%. Benzodiazepines can cross the placenta and may cause respiratory depression, hypotonia, and sedation in newborns. Newborns exposed to alprazolam during pregnancy should be monitored for these symptoms and for signs of withdrawal. Despite early studies suggesting an increased risk of congenital malformations with certain benzodiazepines, recent studies have not confirmed these findings. 
storage and handling: Store at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature]. Dispense contents in a tight, light-resistant container as defined in the USP with a child-resistant closure. KEEP OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN. 
information for patients: Patients should be advised to read the FDA-approved patient labeling. They should be warned about the risks of using alprazolam with opioids, including potentially fatal respiratory depression and sedation. Patients should not drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of the drug combination are known. 

Patients should be informed about the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction associated with alprazolam, even at recommended dosages. They should be educated about the signs and symptoms of benzodiazepine abuse and addiction, and advised to seek medical help if these symptoms develop.

Patients should be warned about withdrawal reactions that can occur with continued use of alprazolam and the potential for a protracted withdrawal syndrome. They should be advised that discontinuation or dosage reduction may require a slow taper.

Patients should be advised not to drive or operate heavy machinery while taking alprazolam due to its CNS depressant effects. They should also avoid alcohol or other CNS depressants.

Patients with depression should be monitored for signs of suicidality or worsening depression. They should be advised to inform their healthcare provider of all medicines they take, including prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, and herbal supplements.

Pregnant women should be advised that use of alprazolam late in pregnancy can result in sedation and/or withdrawal symptoms in newborns. They should be informed about the pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to alprazolam during pregnancy.

Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with alprazolam. For the most recent prescribing information, patients should visit www.sandoz.com.

For Epilepsy with Partial Onset Seizures, the starting dose for patients aged 12 and above is 300 mg three times a day, which can be increased to 600 mg three times a day. For patients aged 3 to 11, the starting dose ranges from 10 to 15 mg/kg/day, given in three divided doses. The recommended dose for patients aged 3 to 4 is 40 mg/kg/day, and for those aged 5 to 11, it's 25 to 35 mg/kg/day. 

The dosage should be adjusted for patients with reduced renal function. For patients with renal impairment or undergoing hemodialysis, the dosage is based on their renal function and creatinine clearance. 

For elderly patients, the dosage should be adjusted based on their creatinine clearance values due to the likelihood of decreased renal function. 

The medication can be administered orally with or without food, and the capsules should be swallowed whole with water. If the dose is reduced, discontinued, or substituted, it should be done gradually over a minimum of 1 week.

contraindications: 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Gabapentin is contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the drug or its ingredients. Known hypersensitivity to gabapentin or its ingredients 
warnings and cautions: The document provides warnings and precautions for the use of the drug gabapentin. It highlights potential risks such as:

1. Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS): Gabapentin should be discontinued if an alternative cause for the symptoms cannot be established.
2. Anaphylaxis and Angioedema: If these occur, gabapentin should be discontinued and the patient should seek immediate medical care.
3. Driving Impairment; Somnolence/Sedation and Dizziness: Patients should not drive or operate heavy machinery until they have assessed whether gabapentin impairs their ability.
4. Increased seizure frequency: This may occur if gabapentin is abruptly discontinued in patients with seizure disorders.
5. Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Patients should be monitored for suicidal thoughts/behavior.
6. Respiratory Depression: This may occur when gabapentin is used with other central nervous system depressants or in patients with underlying respiratory impairment.
7. Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions in Children 3 to 12 Years of Age: Children should be monitored for such events.
8. Tumorigenic Potential: Gabapentin increased the incidence of pancreatic acinar cell tumors in rats, but the clinical significance of this finding is unknown.
9. Sudden and Unexplained Death in Patients with Epilepsy: There were 8 sudden and unexplained deaths recorded among a cohort of 2203 epilepsy patients treated with gabapentin during premarketing development. 
adverse reactions: The document discusses the adverse reactions associated with a drug, with specific sections detailing reactions in different age groups and conditions. Serious reactions include Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), Anaphylaxis, Angioedema, Somnolence/Sedation, Dizziness, Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus, Suicidal Behavior and Ideation, Respiratory Depression, Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions, and Sudden and Unexplained Death in Patients with Epilepsy. 

Common reactions include dizziness, somnolence, peripheral edema, ataxia, fatigue, nystagmus, viral infection, fever, nausea, vomiting, and hostility. Adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in some cases. 

The document also provides information on how to report suspected adverse reactions and discusses the limitations of clinical trials in predicting adverse reaction rates in the general population. 

Postherpetic neuralgia and epilepsy patients experienced different adverse reactions. In postherpetic neuralgia patients, the most common reactions were dizziness, somnolence, and peripheral edema. In epilepsy patients, reactions varied by age. 

Adverse reactions were also reported postmarketing, including hepatobiliary disorders, elevated creatine kinase, elevated liver function tests, hyponatremia, rhabdomyolysis, movement disorder, psychiatric disorders, reproductive system and breast disorders, and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. Life-threatening or fatal respiratory depression has been reported in patients taking the drug with opioids or other CNS depressants, or in those with underlying respiratory impairment. Abrupt discontinuation of the drug has also been associated with adverse reactions. 
pregnancy: A pregnancy exposure registry monitors the outcomes of pregnancies in women who have taken antiepileptic drugs like gabapentin. Women taking gabapentin during pregnancy are encouraged to register with the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. There is insufficient data on the developmental risks of using gabapentin during pregnancy. Nonclinical studies on animals have shown developmental toxicity when gabapentin was administered to pregnant animals. In the general U.S. population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% respectively. The risk for the population indicated is unknown. Animal data shows embryofetal toxicity in mice and adverse effects on offspring development in rats when given gabapentin during pregnancy. Increased embryofetal mortality was observed in rabbits. A study showed that gabapentin caused a significant decrease in neuronal synapse formation in mice. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. 
nursing mothers: 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Gabapentin is secreted in human milk following oral administration. The effects on the breastfed infant and on milk production are unknown. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for gabapentin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from gabapentin or from the underlying maternal condition. 
information for patients: This is patient counseling information for the drug gabapentin. Patients should be aware that:

1. Gabapentin can be taken orally with or without food.
2. Before starting gabapentin, patients should be informed that a rash or other signs of hypersensitivity could indicate a serious medical event. They should report any such symptoms to a doctor immediately.
3. If patients develop signs of anaphylaxis or angioedema, they should stop taking gabapentin and seek medical care.
4. Gabapentin may cause dizziness, somnolence, and other symptoms of CNS depression. Patients should avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until they know how gabapentin affects them.
5. Gabapentin, like other AEDs, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Patients should be alert for worsening depression, changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts.
6. Gabapentin may cause respiratory depression, especially in those using other CNS depressants or those with underlying respiratory impairment. Patients should seek medical attention immediately if this occurs.
7. If patients become pregnant or plan to breastfeed, they should inform their doctor. They are also encouraged to enroll in the NAAED Pregnancy Registry, which collects information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy.

substance name: AMPICILLIN SODIUM 
indications and usage: Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is a treatment for infections caused by certain microorganisms. It is effective against skin and skin structure infections, intra-abdominal infections, and gynecological infections caused by beta-lactamase producing strains of various bacteria. The drug should be used only for the conditions listed, and is also effective against infections caused by ampicillin-susceptible organisms. Before treatment, appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed to identify the organisms causing infection. Therapy may be started before these results are obtained if there is reason to believe the infection may involve any of the listed organisms. Once results are known, therapy should be adjusted if necessary. The drug should only be used to treat infections proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria, to prevent the development of drug-resistant bacteria. If culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered when choosing or modifying therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may guide the selection of therapy. 
dosage and administration: Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection, USP can be administered via IV or IM routes. For IV, the dose can be given slowly over 10-15 minutes or as an infusion over 15-30 minutes. For IM, it should be a deep injection. The recommended adult dosage is 1.5 g to 3 g every six hours, with the total dose of sulbactam not exceeding 4 grams per day. For pediatric patients aged 1 year or older, the recommended daily dose is 300 mg per kg of body weight, given every 6 hours. However, the safety of IM administration in pediatric patients is not established. Pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or more should follow adult dosage recommendations. IV therapy should not exceed 14 days. In patients with impaired renal function, the dosage should be adjusted according to the degree of impairment. The dosage guide is provided in the content for different levels of creatinine clearance. 
contraindications: CONTRAINDICATIONS The use of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is contraindicated in individuals with a history of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis or Stevens-Johnson syndrome) to ampicillin, sulbactam or to other beta-lactam antibacterial drugs (e.g., penicillins and cephalosporins). Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is contraindicated in patients with a previous history of cholestatic jaundice/hepatic dysfunction associated with ampicillin and sulbactam for injection. 
adverse reactions: The injection of Ampicillin and Sulbactam is generally well tolerated in adults. However, some adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials. Local reactions include pain at the injection site and thrombophlebitis. Systemic reactions include diarrhea, rash, itching, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, headache, chest pain, and other less common symptoms. 

In pediatric patients, the adverse events profile is similar to adults, with the addition of atypical lymphocytosis observed in one case. 

Adverse laboratory changes reported during clinical trials include increased liver enzymes, changes in blood cell counts, decreased serum albumin and total proteins, increased BUN and creatinine, and presence of RBC's and hyaline casts in urine. 

Post-marketing experiences have reported additional adverse reactions including blood and lymphatic system disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, general disorders, immune system disorders, nervous system disorders, renal and urinary disorders, respiratory disorders, and skin disorders. 

These reactions are usually reversible upon discontinuation of therapy. Serious and fatal hypersensitivity reactions may occur. To report suspected adverse reactions, contact Meitheal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. or FDA. 
pregnancy: Pregnancy Reproduction studies have been performed in mice, rats, and rabbits at doses up to ten (10) times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to ampicillin and sulbactam for injection. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed (see -PRECAUTIONS-Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions section). 
nursing mothers: Nursing Mothers Low concentrations of ampicillin and sulbactam are excreted in the milk; therefore, caution should be exercised when ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is administered to a nursing woman. 
precautions: Patients with mononucleosis should not be given ampicillin class antibacterials due to the high risk of developing a skin rash. Ampicillin and sulbactam should only be prescribed for bacterial infections, not viral ones, and patients should complete the full course of therapy to prevent bacterial resistance. Diarrhea is a common side effect, and patients should contact their doctor if they develop watery and bloody stools. The drug may interact with probenecid and allopurinol, potentially leading to increased blood levels of ampicillin and sulbactam and an increased incidence of rashes. It should not be mixed with aminoglycosides. High urine concentrations of ampicillin may cause false positive reactions in glucose tests. The drug may also temporarily decrease plasma concentration of certain hormones in pregnant women. Its effects on fertility and during labor and delivery are not fully known. It is excreted in low concentrations in breast milk. The safety and effectiveness of the drug have been established for children over one year old for skin infections, but not for intra-abdominal infections. 
storage and handling: Storage Conditions Prior to reconstitution store at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F); excursions permitted between 15° and 30°C (59° and 86°F).

substance name: DIVALPROEX SODIUM 
indications and usage: Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablet is an anti-epileptic drug used for treating manic episodes related to bipolar disorder, complex partial seizures, simple and complex absence seizures, and for preventing migraine headaches. It is not recommended for acute treatment of migraines. The drug's effectiveness for long-term use in mania has not been proven in controlled clinical trials, so healthcare providers should regularly reassess its usefulness for individual patients. Due to the risk of decreased IQ, neurodevelopmental disorders, neural tube defects, and other major congenital malformations in the fetus, it should not be used by pregnant women or women planning to become pregnant, unless other medications have failed to control symptoms or are unacceptable. It is also contraindicated in women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception. 
dosage and administration: Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets are taken orally and should not be crushed or chewed. The initial dose for mania is 750 mg daily, which can be increased to achieve the desired therapeutic response. For complex partial seizures, the starting dose is 10 to 15 mg/kg/day, which can be increased weekly until optimal response is achieved. For absence seizures, the starting dose is 15 mg/kg/day, which can be increased weekly until seizures are controlled or side effects limit further increases. For migraines, the starting dose is 250 mg twice daily, which can be increased to a maximum of 1,000 mg/day as needed. 

If a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible unless it's almost time for the next dose. Doubling the next dose if one is skipped is not recommended. 

For long-term treatment of mania, there is no data to support the benefits of divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets. However, the safety of long-term use is supported by data from record reviews involving approximately 360 patients treated for more than 3 months. 

For epilepsy, divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets are indicated as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in complex partial seizures in adults and pediatric patients down to the age of 10 years, and in simple and complex absence seizures. 

For elderly patients, the starting dose should be reduced due to a decrease in unbound clearance of valproate and possibly a greater sensitivity to somnolence. The ultimate therapeutic dose should be achieved on the basis of both tolerability and clinical response. 

Patients who experience G.I. irritation may benefit from administration of the drug with food or by slowly building up the dose from an initial low level. 

Patients stabilized on rufinamide before being prescribed valproate should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to a clinically effective dose. 
dosage forms and strengths: 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Tablets: 125 mg, 250 mg and 500 mg ( 3 ) Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets, 125 mg are pink colored, oval shaped, biconvex, enteric coated tablets, imprinted with "L005" (in black ink) on one side and plain on the other side. Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets, 250 mg are pink colored, oval shaped, biconvex, enteric coated tablets, imprinted with "L006" (in black ink) on one side and plain on the other side. Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets, 500 mg are pink colored, oval shaped, biconvex, enteric coated tablets, imprinted with "L007" (in black ink) on one side and plain on the other side. 
contraindications: The use of Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets is contraindicated in the following cases:

1. Patients with hepatic disease or significant hepatic dysfunction.
2. Patients with known mitochondrial disorders caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ (POLG), such as Alpers-Huttenlocher Syndrome.
3. Children under two years of age suspected of having a POLG-related disorder.
4. Patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug.
5. Patients with known urea cycle disorders.
6. For the prevention of migraine headaches, the drug is contraindicated in pregnant women and women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception. 
warnings and cautions: The content provided is a detailed list of warnings and precautions for the use of Divalproex Sodium, a medication used to treat certain types of seizures and manic episodes related to bipolar disorder. 

Key points include:

1. Hepatotoxicity: The drug can cause liver damage. Regular monitoring of liver function is necessary, especially in high-risk populations.

2. Birth defects and neurodevelopmental disorders: The drug should not be used in pregnant women or women planning to become pregnant due to the risk of birth defects and decreased IQ in children exposed to the drug in utero.

3. Pancreatitis: The drug can cause pancreatitis and should be discontinued if this occurs.

4. Suicidal behavior or ideation: The drug can increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior.

5. Bleeding and other hematopoietic disorders: Regular monitoring of platelet counts and coagulation tests is necessary.

6. Hyperammonemia and hyperammonemic encephalopathy: The drug can cause high ammonia levels in the blood, leading to lethargy, vomiting, or changes in mental status.

7. Hypothermia: The drug can cause a drop in body temperature.

8. Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan hypersensitivity reaction: The drug can cause a severe allergic reaction affecting multiple organs.

9. Somnolence in the elderly: The drug can cause drowsiness in elderly patients, and dosage should be increased slowly with regular monitoring.

10. Interaction with Carbapenem Antibiotics: These antibiotics can reduce the effectiveness of the drug, leading to loss of seizure control.

11. Effect on HIV and CMV Viruses Replication: The drug may stimulate the replication of HIV and CMV viruses under certain conditions.

12. Medication Residue in the Stool: There have been rare reports of medication residue in the stool, particularly in patients with shortened GI transit times or diarrhea. 

In all cases, regular monitoring and consultation with a healthcare provider is necessary. 
adverse reactions: The document discusses the adverse reactions to a drug called valproate, used in the treatment of manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder, complex partial seizures, and migraines. The most common side effects (reported in more than 5% of patients) include abdominal pain, blurred vision, memory loss, anorexia, back pain, constipation, depression, diarrhea, dizziness, fever, headache, increased appetite, insomnia, nausea, nervousness, rash, vomiting, weight gain, and weight loss. 

The safety and tolerability of valproate in pediatric patients were found to be similar to those in adults. Serious adverse reactions include hepatic failure, birth defects, decreased IQ following in utero exposure, pancreatitis, hyperammonemic encephalopathy, suicidal behavior and ideation, bleeding and other hematopoietic disorders, hypothermia, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)/multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions. 

In clinical trials, the rates of premature termination due to intolerance were not statistically different between placebo, valproate, and lithium carbonate. Vomiting was the only reaction that was reported by significantly more patients receiving valproate compared to placebo. 

Postmarketing experience has identified additional adverse reactions including changes in hair texture and color, emotional upset, psychosis, aggression, fractures, decreased bone mineral density, irregular menses, weight gain, hearing loss, and allergic reactions. 
pregnancy: The content discusses the risks associated with the use of the antiepileptic drug, divalproex sodium, during pregnancy. There is a registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to this drug. Pregnant women are encouraged to enroll in this registry. 

The drug is contraindicated for use in pregnant women and women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception, especially for the prophylaxis of migraine headaches. For epilepsy or bipolar disorder, it should only be used if other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control. 

The use of this drug during pregnancy increases the risk of congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects, and other body system malformations. It may also result in hearing impairment or hearing loss in the baby. The risk of major structural abnormalities is greatest during the first trimester. 

Children exposed to this drug in utero have lower IQ scores and a higher risk of neurodevelopmental disorders compared to children exposed to either another antiepileptic drug in utero or to no antiepileptic drugs in utero. 

Pregnant women taking this drug may develop hepatic failure or clotting abnormalities, which may result in hemorrhagic complications in the neonate, including death. 

Folic acid supplementation prior to conception and during the first trimester of pregnancy is recommended for patients using this drug, although it is not known whether this reduces the risk of neural tube defects or decreased IQ in the offspring. 

The use of this drug during pregnancy should be carefully considered and monitored due to the associated risks. 
nursing mothers: 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception while taking valproate [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 ), and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . This is especially important when valproate use is considered for a condition not usually associated with permanent injury or death such as prophylaxis of migraine headaches [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Infertility There have been reports of male infertility coincident with valproate therapy [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.4 )] . In animal studies, oral administration of valproate at clinically relevant doses resulted in adverse reproductive effects in males [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 
information for patients: This is a patient counseling information guide for a medication called valproate. It advises patients to be aware of potential side effects such as hepatotoxicity and pancreatitis, which can cause symptoms like nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and anorexia. It also warns of the risk of birth defects and decreased IQ in children if the drug is used during pregnancy. Women are advised to use effective contraception while taking valproate and to discuss pregnancy planning with their doctor. 

The guide also warns of the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior, hyperammonemic encephalopathy, CNS depression, and multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions. Patients are advised to report any concerning symptoms to their healthcare provider immediately. 

The medication may cause drowsiness, especially when combined with other CNS depressants like alcohol, so patients are advised not to engage in hazardous activities until they know how the drug affects them. 

Patients are also advised to report if they notice medication residue in their stool. The medication is manufactured by Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Lupin Limited. 
substance name: ALPRAZOLAM 
indications and usage: 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Alprazolam tablets are indicated for the: • acute treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in adults. • treatment of panic disorder (PD), with or without agoraphobia in adults. Alprazolam tablets are a benzodiazepine indicated for the: • Acute treatment of generalized anxiety disorder in adults. ( 1 ) • Treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults. ( 1 ) 
dosage and administration: The document provides dosage and administration guidelines for alprazolam, a medication used to treat generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and panic disorder (PD). 

For GAD, the starting dosage is 0.25 mg to 0.5 mg three times daily, which can be increased every 3 to 4 days to a maximum of 4 mg daily. The lowest effective dose should be used and the need for continued treatment should be frequently assessed.

For PD, the starting dosage is 0.5 mg three times daily, which can be increased every 3 to 4 days by no more than 1 mg per day. For patients receiving doses greater than 4 mg per day, periodic reassessment and consideration of dosage reduction is advised.

When tapering off alprazolam, the dosage should be decreased by no more than 0.5 mg every 3 days. If withdrawal reactions occur, the taper may need to be paused or the dosage increased to the previous level, then decreased more slowly.

For geriatric patients and those with hepatic impairment, the starting dosage is 0.25 mg, given 2 or 3 times daily, which can be gradually increased if needed and tolerated. If adverse reactions occur, the dosage may be reduced.

When alprazolam is used with ritonavir, the dosage should be reduced to half of the recommended dosage and then increased to the target dose after 10 to 14 days. Alprazolam is contraindicated with concomitant use of all strong CYP3A inhibitors, except ritonavir. 
dosage forms and strengths: 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Alprazolam tablets are available as: • 0.25 mg: white, oval, debossed “GG 256” on one side and scored on the reverse side • 0.5 mg: peach, oval, debossed “GG 257” on one side and scored on the reverse side • 1 mg: blue, oval, debossed “GG 258” on one side and scored on the reverse side • 2 mg: white, rectangular, multi-scored, debossed “GG 249” on one side and plain on the reverse side Tablets: 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, and 2 mg ( 3 ) 
contraindications: 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Alprazolam is contraindicated in patients: • with known hypersensitivity to alprazolam or other benzodiazepines. Angioedema has been reported [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . • taking strong cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole), except ritonavir [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] • Known hypersensitivity to alprazolam or other benzodiazepines. ( 4 ) • Concomitant use with strong cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) inhibitors, except ritonavir. ( 4 , 5.5 , 7.1 ) 
warnings and cautions: The content provides warnings and precautions for the use of alprazolam, a medication often used to treat anxiety and panic disorders. Key points include:

1. Alprazolam can impair driving and operating machinery. Patients should avoid alcohol and other central nervous system depressants while on this medication.
2. Patients with depression should be closely monitored while on alprazolam. The least number of tablets should be prescribed to avoid intentional overdosage.
3. Alprazolam use during pregnancy can lead to neonatal sedation and withdrawal syndrome.
4. The combined use of alprazolam and opioids can lead to severe sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and even death. If these drugs are prescribed together, the lowest effective dosages should be used.
5. Alprazolam can lead to abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can result in overdose or death. Patients should be assessed for these risks before and during treatment.
6. Discontinuing alprazolam abruptly or reducing the dosage rapidly can lead to withdrawal reactions, some of which can be life-threatening.
7. Alprazolam can interact with drugs that inhibit its metabolism, potentially affecting its clearance from the body.
8. Alprazolam may worsen depression and has been associated with episodes of hypomania and mania.
9. Late pregnancy use of alprazolam can result in neonatal sedation and withdrawal symptoms.
10. Patients with impaired respiratory function should be closely monitored while on alprazolam, as there have been reports of death in such patients shortly after starting the medication. 
adverse reactions: The document discusses the adverse reactions associated with the use of a drug, presumably alprazolam. These reactions are categorized into those identified during clinical trials and those reported post-approval. 

In clinical trials, common adverse reactions for generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder included impaired coordination, hypotension, dysarthria, and increased libido. Other reactions were also reported, such as drowsiness, light-headedness, dizziness, dry mouth, increased salivation, hypotension, dermatitis/allergy, and various other symptoms. 

In postmarketing experience, adverse reactions included hyperprolactinemia, peripheral edema, hepatitis, hepatic failure, liver enzyme elevations, hypomania, mania, gynecomastia, galactorrhea, photosensitivity reaction, angioedema, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. 

The document also mentions risks associated with concomitant use with opioids, abuse, misuse, addiction, dependence and withdrawal reactions, effects on driving and operating machinery, patients with depression, neonatal sedation and withdrawal syndrome, and risks in patients with impaired respiratory function. 

Adverse reactions were also reported as reasons for discontinuation of treatment, including insomnia, light-headedness, abnormal involuntary movement, headache, muscular twitching, impaired coordination, muscle tone disorders, weakness, and various other symptoms. 

The document advises that alprazolam should be discontinued if any of these adverse events occur. It also notes that patients with certain conditions, such as borderline personality disorder, a history of violent or aggressive behavior, or alcohol or substance abuse, may be at higher risk for adverse events. 
pregnancy: There is a registry that tracks pregnancy outcomes in women who have been exposed to psychiatric medications, including alprazolam. Healthcare providers are urged to register patients in this registry. Babies born to mothers who used benzodiazepines late in pregnancy may experience symptoms of sedation and/or withdrawal. However, available data does not clearly link benzodiazepines to major birth defects. All pregnancies carry a risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the general U.S. population, the estimated risk of major birth defects is 2% to 4% and miscarriage is 15% to 20%. Benzodiazepines can cross the placenta and may cause respiratory depression, hypotonia, and sedation in newborns. Newborns exposed to alprazolam during pregnancy should be monitored for these symptoms and for signs of withdrawal. Despite early studies suggesting an increased risk of congenital malformations with certain benzodiazepines, recent studies have not confirmed these findings. 
storage and handling: Store at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature]. Dispense contents in a tight, light-resistant container as defined in the USP with a child-resistant closure. KEEP OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN. 
information for patients: Patients should be advised to read the FDA-approved patient labeling. They should be warned about the risks of using alprazolam with opioids, including potentially fatal respiratory depression and sedation. Patients should not drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of the drug combination are known. 

Patients should be informed about the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction associated with alprazolam, even at recommended dosages. They should be educated about the signs and symptoms of benzodiazepine abuse and addiction, and advised to seek medical help if these symptoms develop.

Patients should be warned about withdrawal reactions that can occur with continued use of alprazolam and the potential for a protracted withdrawal syndrome. They should be advised that discontinuation or dosage reduction may require a slow taper.

Patients should be advised not to drive or operate heavy machinery while taking alprazolam due to its CNS depressant effects. They should also avoid alcohol or other CNS depressants.

Patients with depression should be monitored for signs of suicidality or worsening depression. They should be advised to inform their healthcare provider of all medicines they take, including prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, and herbal supplements.

Pregnant women should be advised that use of alprazolam late in pregnancy can result in sedation and/or withdrawal symptoms in newborns. They should be informed about the pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to alprazolam during pregnancy.

Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with alprazolam. For the most recent prescribing information, patients should visit www.sandoz.com.

indications and usage: 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Gabapentin is indicated for: • Management of postherpetic neuralgia in adults • Adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures, with and without secondary generalization, in adults and pediatric patients 3 years and older with epilepsy Gabapentin is indicated for: • Postherpetic neuralgia in adults ( 1 ) • Adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures, with and without secondary generalization, in adults and pediatric patients 3 years and older with epilepsy ( 1 ) 
dosage and administration: The given content provides dosage and administration instructions for a medication used to treat Postherpetic Neuralgia and Epilepsy with Partial Onset Seizures. 

For Postherpetic Neuralgia, the medication can be started with a single 300 mg dose on Day 1, increased to 600 mg/day on Day 2, and 900 mg/day on Day 3. The dose can be further increased to 1800 mg/day if needed for pain relief. 

For Epilepsy with Partial Onset Seizures, the starting dose for patients aged 12 and above is 300 mg three times a day, which can be increased to 600 mg three times a day. For patients aged 3 to 11, the starting dose ranges from 10 to 15 mg/kg/day, given in three divided doses. The recommended dose for patients aged 3 to 4 is 40 mg/kg/day, and for those aged 5 to 11, it's 25 to 35 mg/kg/day. 

The dosage should be adjusted for patients with reduced renal function. For patients with renal impairment or undergoing hemodialysis, the dosage is based on their renal function and creatinine clearance. 

For elderly patients, the dosage should be adjusted based on their creatinine clearance values due to the likelihood of decreased renal function. 

The medication can be administered orally with or without food, and the capsules should be swallowed whole with water. If the dose is reduced, discontinued, or substituted, it should be done gradually over a minimum of 1 week. 
dosage forms and strengths: 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Capsules 100 mg: White hard gelatin capsules imprinted “216” on body with blue ink. 300 mg: Yellow hard gelatin capsules imprinted “215” on body with blue ink. 400 mg: Orange hard gelatin capsules imprinted “214” on body with blue ink. Capsules: 100 mg, 300 mg, and 400 mg (3) 
contraindications: 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Gabapentin is contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the drug or its ingredients. Known hypersensitivity to gabapentin or its ingredients 
warnings and cautions: The document provides warnings and precautions for the use of the drug gabapentin. It highlights potential risks such as:

1. Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS): Gabapentin should be discontinued if an alternative cause for the symptoms cannot be established.
2. Anaphylaxis and Angioedema: If these occur, gabapentin should be discontinued and the patient should seek immediate medical care.
3. Driving Impairment; Somnolence/Sedation and Dizziness: Patients should not drive or operate heavy machinery until they have assessed whether gabapentin impairs their ability.
4. Increased seizure frequency: This may occur if gabapentin is abruptly discontinued in patients with seizure disorders.
5. Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Patients should be monitored for suicidal thoughts/behavior.
6. Respiratory Depression: This may occur when gabapentin is used with other central nervous system depressants or in patients with underlying respiratory impairment.
7. Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions in Children 3 to 12 Years of Age: Children should be monitored for such events.
8. Tumorigenic Potential: Gabapentin increased the incidence of pancreatic acinar cell tumors in rats, but the clinical significance of this finding is unknown.
9. Sudden and Unexplained Death in Patients with Epilepsy: There were 8 sudden and unexplained deaths recorded among a cohort of 2203 epilepsy patients treated with gabapentin during premarketing development. 
adverse reactions: The document discusses the adverse reactions associated with a drug, with specific sections detailing reactions in different age groups and conditions. Serious reactions include Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), Anaphylaxis, Angioedema, Somnolence/Sedation, Dizziness, Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus, Suicidal Behavior and Ideation, Respiratory Depression, Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions, and Sudden and Unexplained Death in Patients with Epilepsy. 

Common reactions include dizziness, somnolence, peripheral edema, ataxia, fatigue, nystagmus, viral infection, fever, nausea, vomiting, and hostility. Adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in some cases. 

The document also provides information on how to report suspected adverse reactions and discusses the limitations of clinical trials in predicting adverse reaction rates in the general population. 

Postherpetic neuralgia and epilepsy patients experienced different adverse reactions. In postherpetic neuralgia patients, the most common reactions were dizziness, somnolence, and peripheral edema. In epilepsy patients, reactions varied by age. 

Adverse reactions were also reported postmarketing, including hepatobiliary disorders, elevated creatine kinase, elevated liver function tests, hyponatremia, rhabdomyolysis, movement disorder, psychiatric disorders, reproductive system and breast disorders, and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. Life-threatening or fatal respiratory depression has been reported in patients taking the drug with opioids or other CNS depressants, or in those with underlying respiratory impairment. Abrupt discontinuation of the drug has also been associated with adverse reactions. 
pregnancy: A pregnancy exposure registry monitors the outcomes of pregnancies in women who have taken antiepileptic drugs like gabapentin. Women taking gabapentin during pregnancy are encouraged to register with the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. There is insufficient data on the developmental risks of using gabapentin during pregnancy. Nonclinical studies on animals have shown developmental toxicity when gabapentin was administered to pregnant animals. In the general U.S. population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% respectively. The risk for the population indicated is unknown. Animal data shows embryofetal toxicity in mice and adverse effects on offspring development in rats when given gabapentin during pregnancy. Increased embryofetal mortality was observed in rabbits. A study showed that gabapentin caused a significant decrease in neuronal synapse formation in mice. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. 
nursing mothers: 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Gabapentin is secreted in human milk following oral administration. The effects on the breastfed infant and on milk production are unknown. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for gabapentin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from gabapentin or from the underlying maternal condition. 
information for patients: This is patient counseling information for the drug gabapentin. Patients should be aware that:

1. Gabapentin can be taken orally with or without food.
2. Before starting gabapentin, patients should be informed that a rash or other signs of hypersensitivity could indicate a serious medical event. They should report any such symptoms to a doctor immediately.
3. If patients develop signs of anaphylaxis or angioedema, they should stop taking gabapentin and seek medical care.
4. Gabapentin may cause dizziness, somnolence, and other symptoms of CNS depression. Patients should avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until they know how gabapentin affects them.
5. Gabapentin, like other AEDs, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Patients should be alert for worsening depression, changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts.
6. Gabapentin may cause respiratory depression, especially in those using other CNS depressants or those with underlying respiratory impairment. Patients should seek medical attention immediately if this occurs.
7. If patients become pregnant or plan to breastfeed, they should inform their doctor. They are also encouraged to enroll in the NAAED Pregnancy Registry, which collects information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy.

substance name: AMPICILLIN SODIUM 
indications and usage: Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is a treatment for infections caused by certain microorganisms. It is effective against skin and skin structure infections, intra-abdominal infections, and gynecological infections caused by beta-lactamase producing strains of various bacteria. The drug should be used only for the conditions listed, and is also effective against infections caused by ampicillin-susceptible organisms. Before treatment, appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed to identify the organisms causing infection. Therapy may be started before these results are obtained if there is reason to believe the infection may involve any of the listed organisms. Once results are known, therapy should be adjusted if necessary. The drug should only be used to treat infections proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria, to prevent the development of drug-resistant bacteria. If culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered when choosing or modifying therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may guide the selection of therapy. 
dosage and administration: Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection, USP can be administered via IV or IM routes. For IV, the dose can be given slowly over 10-15 minutes or as an infusion over 15-30 minutes. For IM, it should be a deep injection. The recommended adult dosage is 1.5 g to 3 g every six hours, with the total dose of sulbactam not exceeding 4 grams per day. For pediatric patients aged 1 year or older, the recommended daily dose is 300 mg per kg of body weight, given every 6 hours. However, the safety of IM administration in pediatric patients is not established. Pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or more should follow adult dosage recommendations. IV therapy should not exceed 14 days. In patients with impaired renal function, the dosage should be adjusted according to the degree of impairment. The dosage guide is provided in the content for different levels of creatinine clearance. 
contraindications: CONTRAINDICATIONS The use of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is contraindicated in individuals with a history of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis or Stevens-Johnson syndrome) to ampicillin, sulbactam or to other beta-lactam antibacterial drugs (e.g., penicillins and cephalosporins). Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is contraindicated in patients with a previous history of cholestatic jaundice/hepatic dysfunction associated with ampicillin and sulbactam for injection. 
adverse reactions: The injection of Ampicillin and Sulbactam is generally well tolerated in adults. However, some adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials. Local reactions include pain at the injection site and thrombophlebitis. Systemic reactions include diarrhea, rash, itching, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, headache, chest pain, and other less common symptoms. 

In pediatric patients, the adverse events profile is similar to adults, with the addition of atypical lymphocytosis observed in one case. 

Adverse laboratory changes reported during clinical trials include increased liver enzymes, changes in blood cell counts, decreased serum albumin and total proteins, increased BUN and creatinine, and presence of RBC's and hyaline casts in urine. 

Post-marketing experiences have reported additional adverse reactions including blood and lymphatic system disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, general disorders, immune system disorders, nervous system disorders, renal and urinary disorders, respiratory disorders, and skin disorders. 

These reactions are usually reversible upon discontinuation of therapy. Serious and fatal hypersensitivity reactions may occur. To report suspected adverse reactions, contact Meitheal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. or FDA. 
pregnancy: Pregnancy Reproduction studies have been performed in mice, rats, and rabbits at doses up to ten (10) times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to ampicillin and sulbactam for injection. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed (see -PRECAUTIONS-Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions section). 
nursing mothers: Nursing Mothers Low concentrations of ampicillin and sulbactam are excreted in the milk; therefore, caution should be exercised when ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is administered to a nursing woman. 
precautions: Patients with mononucleosis should not be given ampicillin class antibacterials due to the high risk of developing a skin rash. Ampicillin and sulbactam should only be prescribed for bacterial infections, not viral ones, and patients should complete the full course of therapy to prevent bacterial resistance. Diarrhea is a common side effect, and patients should contact their doctor if they develop watery and bloody stools. The drug may interact with probenecid and allopurinol, potentially leading to increased blood levels of ampicillin and sulbactam and an increased incidence of rashes. It should not be mixed with aminoglycosides. High urine concentrations of ampicillin may cause false positive reactions in glucose tests. The drug may also temporarily decrease plasma concentration of certain hormones in pregnant women. Its effects on fertility and during labor and delivery are not fully known. It is excreted in low concentrations in breast milk. The safety and effectiveness of the drug have been established for children over one year old for skin infections, but not for intra-abdominal infections. 
storage and handling: Storage Conditions Prior to reconstitution store at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F); excursions permitted between 15° and 30°C (59° and 86°F).

substance name: DIVALPROEX SODIUM 
indications and usage: Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablet is an anti-epileptic drug used for treating manic episodes related to bipolar disorder, complex partial seizures, simple and complex absence seizures, and for preventing migraine headaches. It is not recommended for acute treatment of migraines. The drug's effectiveness for long-term use in mania has not been proven in controlled clinical trials, so healthcare providers should regularly reassess its usefulness for individual patients. Due to the risk of decreased IQ, neurodevelopmental disorders, neural tube defects, and other major congenital malformations in the fetus, it should not be used by pregnant women or women planning to become pregnant, unless other medications have failed to control symptoms or are unacceptable. It is also contraindicated in women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception. 
dosage and administration: Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets are taken orally and should not be crushed or chewed. The initial dose for mania is 750 mg daily, which can be increased to achieve the desired therapeutic response. For complex partial seizures, the starting dose is 10 to 15 mg/kg/day, which can be increased weekly until optimal response is achieved. For absence seizures, the starting dose is 15 mg/kg/day, which can be increased weekly until seizures are controlled or side effects limit further increases. For migraines, the starting dose is 250 mg twice daily, which can be increased to a maximum of 1,000 mg/day as needed. 

If a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible unless it's almost time for the next dose. Doubling the next dose if one is skipped is not recommended. 

For long-term treatment of mania, there is no data to support the benefits of divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets. However, the safety of long-term use is supported by data from record reviews involving approximately 360 patients treated for more than 3 months. 

For epilepsy, divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets are indicated as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in complex partial seizures in adults and pediatric patients down to the age of 10 years, and in simple and complex absence seizures. 

For elderly patients, the starting dose should be reduced due to a decrease in unbound clearance of valproate and possibly a greater sensitivity to somnolence. The ultimate therapeutic dose should be achieved on the basis of both tolerability and clinical response. 

Patients who experience G.I. irritation may benefit from administration of the drug with food or by slowly building up the dose from an initial low level. 

Patients stabilized on rufinamide before being prescribed valproate should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to a clinically effective dose. 
dosage forms and strengths: 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Tablets: 125 mg, 250 mg and 500 mg ( 3 ) Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets, 125 mg are pink colored, oval shaped, biconvex, enteric coated tablets, imprinted with "L005" (in black ink) on one side and plain on the other side. Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets, 250 mg are pink colored, oval shaped, biconvex, enteric coated tablets, imprinted with "L006" (in black ink) on one side and plain on the other side. Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets, 500 mg are pink colored, oval shaped, biconvex, enteric coated tablets, imprinted with "L007" (in black ink) on one side and plain on the other side. 
contraindications: The use of Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets is contraindicated in the following cases:

1. Patients with hepatic disease or significant hepatic dysfunction.
2. Patients with known mitochondrial disorders caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ (POLG), such as Alpers-Huttenlocher Syndrome.
3. Children under two years of age suspected of having a POLG-related disorder.
4. Patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug.
5. Patients with known urea cycle disorders.
6. For the prevention of migraine headaches, the drug is contraindicated in pregnant women and women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception. 
warnings and cautions: The content provided is a detailed list of warnings and precautions for the use of Divalproex Sodium, a medication used to treat certain types of seizures and manic episodes related to bipolar disorder. 

Key points include:

1. Hepatotoxicity: The drug can cause liver damage. Regular monitoring of liver function is necessary, especially in high-risk populations.

2. Birth defects and neurodevelopmental disorders: The drug should not be used in pregnant women or women planning to become pregnant due to the risk of birth defects and decreased IQ in children exposed to the drug in utero.

3. Pancreatitis: The drug can cause pancreatitis and should be discontinued if this occurs.

4. Suicidal behavior or ideation: The drug can increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior.

5. Bleeding and other hematopoietic disorders: Regular monitoring of platelet counts and coagulation tests is necessary.

6. Hyperammonemia and hyperammonemic encephalopathy: The drug can cause high ammonia levels in the blood, leading to lethargy, vomiting, or changes in mental status.

7. Hypothermia: The drug can cause a drop in body temperature.

8. Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan hypersensitivity reaction: The drug can cause a severe allergic reaction affecting multiple organs.

9. Somnolence in the elderly: The drug can cause drowsiness in elderly patients, and dosage should be increased slowly with regular monitoring.

10. Interaction with Carbapenem Antibiotics: These antibiotics can reduce the effectiveness of the drug, leading to loss of seizure control.

11. Effect on HIV and CMV Viruses Replication: The drug may stimulate the replication of HIV and CMV viruses under certain conditions.

12. Medication Residue in the Stool: There have been rare reports of medication residue in the stool, particularly in patients with shortened GI transit times or diarrhea. 

In all cases, regular monitoring and consultation with a healthcare provider is necessary. 
adverse reactions: The document discusses the adverse reactions to a drug called valproate, used in the treatment of manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder, complex partial seizures, and migraines. The most common side effects (reported in more than 5% of patients) include abdominal pain, blurred vision, memory loss, anorexia, back pain, constipation, depression, diarrhea, dizziness, fever, headache, increased appetite, insomnia, nausea, nervousness, rash, vomiting, weight gain, and weight loss. 

The safety and tolerability of valproate in pediatric patients were found to be similar to those in adults. Serious adverse reactions include hepatic failure, birth defects, decreased IQ following in utero exposure, pancreatitis, hyperammonemic encephalopathy, suicidal behavior and ideation, bleeding and other hematopoietic disorders, hypothermia, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)/multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions. 

In clinical trials, the rates of premature termination due to intolerance were not statistically different between placebo, valproate, and lithium carbonate. Vomiting was the only reaction that was reported by significantly more patients receiving valproate compared to placebo. 

Postmarketing experience has identified additional adverse reactions including changes in hair texture and color, emotional upset, psychosis, aggression, fractures, decreased bone mineral density, irregular menses, weight gain, hearing loss, and allergic reactions. 
pregnancy: The content discusses the risks associated with the use of the antiepileptic drug, divalproex sodium, during pregnancy. There is a registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to this drug. Pregnant women are encouraged to enroll in this registry. 

The drug is contraindicated for use in pregnant women and women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception, especially for the prophylaxis of migraine headaches. For epilepsy or bipolar disorder, it should only be used if other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control. 

The use of this drug during pregnancy increases the risk of congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects, and other body system malformations. It may also result in hearing impairment or hearing loss in the baby. The risk of major structural abnormalities is greatest during the first trimester. 

Children exposed to this drug in utero have lower IQ scores and a higher risk of neurodevelopmental disorders compared to children exposed to either another antiepileptic drug in utero or to no antiepileptic drugs in utero. 

Pregnant women taking this drug may develop hepatic failure or clotting abnormalities, which may result in hemorrhagic complications in the neonate, including death. 

Folic acid supplementation prior to conception and during the first trimester of pregnancy is recommended for patients using this drug, although it is not known whether this reduces the risk of neural tube defects or decreased IQ in the offspring. 

The use of this drug during pregnancy should be carefully considered and monitored due to the associated risks. 
nursing mothers: 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception while taking valproate [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 ), and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . This is especially important when valproate use is considered for a condition not usually associated with permanent injury or death such as prophylaxis of migraine headaches [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Infertility There have been reports of male infertility coincident with valproate therapy [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.4 )] . In animal studies, oral administration of valproate at clinically relevant doses resulted in adverse reproductive effects in males [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 
information for patients: This is a patient counseling information guide for a medication called valproate. It advises patients to be aware of potential side effects such as hepatotoxicity and pancreatitis, which can cause symptoms like nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and anorexia. It also warns of the risk of birth defects and decreased IQ in children if the drug is used during pregnancy. Women are advised to use effective contraception while taking valproate and to discuss pregnancy planning with their doctor. 

The guide also warns of the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior, hyperammonemic encephalopathy, CNS depression, and multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions. Patients are advised to report any concerning symptoms to their healthcare provider immediately. 

The medication may cause drowsiness, especially when combined with other CNS depressants like alcohol, so patients are advised not to engage in hazardous activities until they know how the drug affects them. 

Patients are also advised to report if they notice medication residue in their stool. The medication is manufactured by Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Lupin Limited. 
substance name: ALPRAZOLAM 
indications and usage: 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Alprazolam tablets are indicated for the: • acute treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in adults. • treatment of panic disorder (PD), with or without agoraphobia in adults. Alprazolam tablets are a benzodiazepine indicated for the: • Acute treatment of generalized anxiety disorder in adults. ( 1 ) • Treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults. ( 1 ) 
dosage and administration: The document provides dosage and administration guidelines for alprazolam, a medication used to treat generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and panic disorder (PD). 

For GAD, the starting dosage is 0.25 mg to 0.5 mg three times daily, which can be increased every 3 to 4 days to a maximum of 4 mg daily. The lowest effective dose should be used and the need for continued treatment should be frequently assessed.

For PD, the starting dosage is 0.5 mg three times daily, which can be increased every 3 to 4 days by no more than 1 mg per day. For patients receiving doses greater than 4 mg per day, periodic reassessment and consideration of dosage reduction is advised.

When tapering off alprazolam, the dosage should be decreased by no more than 0.5 mg every 3 days. If withdrawal reactions occur, the taper may need to be paused or the dosage increased to the previous level, then decreased more slowly.

For geriatric patients and those with hepatic impairment, the starting dosage is 0.25 mg, given 2 or 3 times daily, which can be gradually increased if needed and tolerated. If adverse reactions occur, the dosage may be reduced.

When alprazolam is used with ritonavir, the dosage should be reduced to half of the recommended dosage and then increased to the target dose after 10 to 14 days. Alprazolam is contraindicated with concomitant use of all strong CYP3A inhibitors, except ritonavir. 
dosage forms and strengths: 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Alprazolam tablets are available as: • 0.25 mg: white, oval, debossed “GG 256” on one side and scored on the reverse side • 0.5 mg: peach, oval, debossed “GG 257” on one side and scored on the reverse side • 1 mg: blue, oval, debossed “GG 258” on one side and scored on the reverse side • 2 mg: white, rectangular, multi-scored, debossed “GG 249” on one side and plain on the reverse side Tablets: 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, and 2 mg ( 3 )

Angioedema has been reported [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . • taking strong cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole), except ritonavir [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] • Known hypersensitivity to alprazolam or other benzodiazepines. ( 4 ) • Concomitant use with strong cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) inhibitors, except ritonavir. ( 4 , 5.5 , 7.1 ) 
warnings and cautions: The content provides warnings and precautions for the use of alprazolam, a medication often used to treat anxiety and panic disorders. Key points include:

1. Alprazolam can impair driving and operating machinery. Patients should avoid alcohol and other central nervous system depressants while on this medication.
2. Patients with depression should be closely monitored while on alprazolam. The least number of tablets should be prescribed to avoid intentional overdosage.
3. Alprazolam use during pregnancy can lead to neonatal sedation and withdrawal syndrome.
4. The combined use of alprazolam and opioids can lead to severe sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and even death. If these drugs are prescribed together, the lowest effective dosages should be used.
5. Alprazolam can lead to abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can result in overdose or death. Patients should be assessed for these risks before and during treatment.
6. Discontinuing alprazolam abruptly or reducing the dosage rapidly can lead to withdrawal reactions, some of which can be life-threatening.
7. Alprazolam can interact with drugs that inhibit its metabolism, potentially affecting its clearance from the body.
8. Alprazolam may worsen depression and has been associated with episodes of hypomania and mania.
9. Late pregnancy use of alprazolam can result in neonatal sedation and withdrawal symptoms.
10. Patients with impaired respiratory function should be closely monitored while on alprazolam, as there have been reports of death in such patients shortly after starting the medication. 
adverse reactions: The document discusses the adverse reactions associated with the use of a drug, presumably alprazolam. These reactions are categorized into those identified during clinical trials and those reported post-approval. 

In clinical trials, common adverse reactions for generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder included impaired coordination, hypotension, dysarthria, and increased libido. Other reactions were also reported, such as drowsiness, light-headedness, dizziness, dry mouth, increased salivation, hypotension, dermatitis/allergy, and various other symptoms. 

In postmarketing experience, adverse reactions included hyperprolactinemia, peripheral edema, hepatitis, hepatic failure, liver enzyme elevations, hypomania, mania, gynecomastia, galactorrhea, photosensitivity reaction, angioedema, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. 

The document also mentions risks associated with concomitant use with opioids, abuse, misuse, addiction, dependence and withdrawal reactions, effects on driving and operating machinery, patients with depression, neonatal sedation and withdrawal syndrome, and risks in patients with impaired respiratory function. 

Adverse reactions were also reported as reasons for discontinuation of treatment, including insomnia, light-headedness, abnormal involuntary movement, headache, muscular twitching, impaired coordination, muscle tone disorders, weakness, and various other symptoms. 

The document advises that alprazolam should be discontinued if any of these adverse events occur. It also notes that patients with certain conditions, such as borderline personality disorder, a history of violent or aggressive behavior, or alcohol or substance abuse, may be at higher risk for adverse events. 
pregnancy: There is a registry that tracks pregnancy outcomes in women who have been exposed to psychiatric medications, including alprazolam. Healthcare providers are urged to register patients in this registry. Babies born to mothers who used benzodiazepines late in pregnancy may experience symptoms of sedation and/or withdrawal. However, available data does not clearly link benzodiazepines to major birth defects. All pregnancies carry a risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the general U.S. population, the estimated risk of major birth defects is 2% to 4% and miscarriage is 15% to 20%. Benzodiazepines can cross the placenta and may cause respiratory depression, hypotonia, and sedation in newborns. Newborns exposed to alprazolam during pregnancy should be monitored for these symptoms and for signs of withdrawal. Despite early studies suggesting an increased risk of congenital malformations with certain benzodiazepines, recent studies have not confirmed these findings. 
storage and handling: Store at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature]. Dispense contents in a tight, light-resistant container as defined in the USP with a child-resistant closure. KEEP OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN. 
information for patients: Patients should be advised to read the FDA-approved patient labeling. They should be warned about the risks of using alprazolam with opioids, including potentially fatal respiratory depression and sedation. Patients should not drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of the drug combination are known. 

Patients should be informed about the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction associated with alprazolam, even at recommended dosages. They should be educated about the signs and symptoms of benzodiazepine abuse and addiction, and advised to seek medical help if these symptoms develop.

Patients should be warned about withdrawal reactions that can occur with continued use of alprazolam and the potential for a protracted withdrawal syndrome. They should be advised that discontinuation or dosage reduction may require a slow taper.

Patients should be advised not to drive or operate heavy machinery while taking alprazolam due to its CNS depressant effects. They should also avoid alcohol or other CNS depressants.

Patients with depression should be monitored for signs of suicidality or worsening depression. They should be advised to inform their healthcare provider of all medicines they take, including prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, and herbal supplements.

Pregnant women should be advised that use of alprazolam late in pregnancy can result in sedation and/or withdrawal symptoms in newborns. They should be informed about the pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to alprazolam during pregnancy.

Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with alprazolam. For the most recent prescribing information, patients should visit www.sandoz.com.

Promethazine hydrochloride tablets, USP are contraindicated in comatose states, and in individuals known to be hypersensitive or to have had an idiosyncratic reaction to promethazine or to other phenothiazines. Antihistamines are contraindicated for use in the treatment of lower respiratory tract symptoms including asthma. 
adverse reactions: The drug in question can cause a variety of adverse reactions. The most common effect on the central nervous system is drowsiness, but it can also cause sedation, blurred vision, dizziness, confusion, disorientation, and various other symptoms. Hallucinations have been reported as well. Cardiovascular effects can include changes in blood pressure and heart rate, as well as faintness. Dermatologic reactions can include dermatitis, photosensitivity, and urticaria. Hematologic reactions can include leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and agranulocytosis. Gastrointestinal reactions can include dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice. Respiratory reactions can include asthma, nasal stuffiness, and potentially fatal respiratory depression and apnea. Other reactions can include angioneurotic edema and potentially fatal neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Hyperexcitability and abnormal movements have been reported after a single dose. If these occur, discontinuation of the drug and use of other drugs should be considered. Respiratory depression, nightmares, delirium, and agitated behavior have also been reported in some patients. 
pregnancy: Promethazine hydrochloride, a drug classified under Pregnancy Category C, has not shown teratogenic (harmful to fetus) effects in rat studies at certain doses. However, higher daily doses have resulted in fetal mortality in rats. No specific studies have been conducted on the drug's impact on childbirth, lactation, and neonatal development, but preliminary studies suggest no effect. The drug's effects in rodents do not necessarily reflect its effects in humans. There are no comprehensive studies on the use of promethazine hydrochloride tablets in pregnant women. Therefore, they should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the fetus. Additionally, administering these tablets to a pregnant woman close to delivery may inhibit platelet aggregation in the newborn. 
nursing mothers: Nursing Mothers It is not known whether promethazine hydrochloride is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from promethazine hydrochloride tablets, USP a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 
precautions: Promethazine hydrochloride tablets should be used with caution in patients with certain conditions such as narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, and liver function impairment. The drug may cause drowsiness and impair mental and physical abilities, potentially affecting tasks like driving or operating machinery. It can also interact with other central-nervous-system depressants, potentially enhancing impairment. 

Patients should avoid prolonged sun exposure and report any involuntary muscle movements. The drug may also affect certain laboratory tests, including pregnancy tests and glucose tolerance tests. 

There is no conclusive data on the drug's potential carcinogenic effects, mutagenicity, or impairment of fertility. It should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus. 

The drug may inhibit platelet aggregation in newborns if administered to a pregnant woman within two weeks of delivery. It is unknown whether the drug is excreted in human milk, so a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or the drug. 

The drug is not recommended for use in children under two years of age and should be used with caution in children over two years of age. Elderly patients should start with low doses due to the potential for confusion and over-sedation. 
information for patients: Information for Patients Promethazine hydrochloride tablets, USP may cause marked drowsiness or impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery. The use of alcohol or other central-nervous-system depressants such as sedatives/hypnotics (including barbiturates), narcotics, narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, tricyclic antidepressants, and tranquilizers, may enhance impairment ( see WARNINGS-CNS Depression and PRECAUTIONS-Drug Interactions ). Pediatric patients should be supervised to avoid potential harm in bike riding or in other hazardous activities. Patients should be advised to report any involuntary muscle movements. Avoid prolonged exposure to the sun.

dosage and administration: The given content provides dosage and administration instructions for a medication used to treat Postherpetic Neuralgia and Epilepsy with Partial Onset Seizures. 

For Postherpetic Neuralgia, the medication can be started with a single 300 mg dose on Day 1, increased to 600 mg/day on Day 2, and 900 mg/day on Day 3. The dose can be further increased to 1800 mg/day if needed for pain relief. 

For Epilepsy with Partial Onset Seizures, the starting dose for patients aged 12 and above is 300 mg three times a day, which can be increased to 600 mg three times a day. For patients aged 3 to 11, the starting dose ranges from 10 to 15 mg/kg/day, given in three divided doses. The recommended dose for patients aged 3 to 4 is 40 mg/kg/day, and for those aged 5 to 11, it's 25 to 35 mg/kg/day. 

The dosage should be adjusted for patients with reduced renal function. For patients with renal impairment or undergoing hemodialysis, the dosage is based on their renal function and creatinine clearance. 

For elderly patients, the dosage should be adjusted based on their creatinine clearance values due to the likelihood of decreased renal function. 

The medication can be administered orally with or without food, and the capsules should be swallowed whole with water. If the dose is reduced, discontinued, or substituted, it should be done gradually over a minimum of 1 week.

contraindications: 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Gabapentin is contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the drug or its ingredients. Known hypersensitivity to gabapentin or its ingredients 
warnings and cautions: The document provides warnings and precautions for the use of the drug gabapentin. It highlights potential risks such as:

1. Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS): Gabapentin should be discontinued if an alternative cause for the symptoms cannot be established.
2. Anaphylaxis and Angioedema: If these occur, gabapentin should be discontinued and the patient should seek immediate medical care.
3. Driving Impairment; Somnolence/Sedation and Dizziness: Patients should not drive or operate heavy machinery until they have assessed whether gabapentin impairs their ability.
4. Increased seizure frequency: This may occur if gabapentin is abruptly discontinued in patients with seizure disorders.
5. Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Patients should be monitored for suicidal thoughts/behavior.
6. Respiratory Depression: This may occur when gabapentin is used with other central nervous system depressants or in patients with underlying respiratory impairment.
7. Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions in Children 3 to 12 Years of Age: Children should be monitored for such events.
8. Tumorigenic Potential: Gabapentin increased the incidence of pancreatic acinar cell tumors in rats, but the clinical significance of this finding is unknown.
9. Sudden and Unexplained Death in Patients with Epilepsy: There were 8 sudden and unexplained deaths recorded among a cohort of 2203 epilepsy patients treated with gabapentin during premarketing development. 
adverse reactions: The document discusses the adverse reactions associated with a drug, with specific sections detailing reactions in different age groups and conditions. Serious reactions include Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), Anaphylaxis, Angioedema, Somnolence/Sedation, Dizziness, Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus, Suicidal Behavior and Ideation, Respiratory Depression, Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions, and Sudden and Unexplained Death in Patients with Epilepsy. 

Common reactions include dizziness, somnolence, peripheral edema, ataxia, fatigue, nystagmus, viral infection, fever, nausea, vomiting, and hostility. Adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in some cases. 

The document also provides information on how to report suspected adverse reactions and discusses the limitations of clinical trials in predicting adverse reaction rates in the general population. 

Postherpetic neuralgia and epilepsy patients experienced different adverse reactions. In postherpetic neuralgia patients, the most common reactions were dizziness, somnolence, and peripheral edema. In epilepsy patients, reactions varied by age. 

Adverse reactions were also reported postmarketing, including hepatobiliary disorders, elevated creatine kinase, elevated liver function tests, hyponatremia, rhabdomyolysis, movement disorder, psychiatric disorders, reproductive system and breast disorders, and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. Life-threatening or fatal respiratory depression has been reported in patients taking the drug with opioids or other CNS depressants, or in those with underlying respiratory impairment. Abrupt discontinuation of the drug has also been associated with adverse reactions. 
pregnancy: A pregnancy exposure registry monitors the outcomes of pregnancies in women who have taken antiepileptic drugs like gabapentin. Women taking gabapentin during pregnancy are encouraged to register with the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. There is insufficient data on the developmental risks of using gabapentin during pregnancy. Nonclinical studies on animals have shown developmental toxicity when gabapentin was administered to pregnant animals. In the general U.S. population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% respectively. The risk for the population indicated is unknown. Animal data shows embryofetal toxicity in mice and adverse effects on offspring development in rats when given gabapentin during pregnancy. Increased embryofetal mortality was observed in rabbits. A study showed that gabapentin caused a significant decrease in neuronal synapse formation in mice. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. 
nursing mothers: 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Gabapentin is secreted in human milk following oral administration. The effects on the breastfed infant and on milk production are unknown. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for gabapentin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from gabapentin or from the underlying maternal condition. 
information for patients: This is patient counseling information for the drug gabapentin. Patients should be aware that:

1. Gabapentin can be taken orally with or without food.
2. Before starting gabapentin, patients should be informed that a rash or other signs of hypersensitivity could indicate a serious medical event. They should report any such symptoms to a doctor immediately.
3. If patients develop signs of anaphylaxis or angioedema, they should stop taking gabapentin and seek medical care.
4. Gabapentin may cause dizziness, somnolence, and other symptoms of CNS depression. Patients should avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until they know how gabapentin affects them.
5. Gabapentin, like other AEDs, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Patients should be alert for worsening depression, changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts.
6. Gabapentin may cause respiratory depression, especially in those using other CNS depressants or those with underlying respiratory impairment. Patients should seek medical attention immediately if this occurs.
7. If patients become pregnant or plan to breastfeed, they should inform their doctor. They are also encouraged to enroll in the NAAED Pregnancy Registry, which collects information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy.

substance name: AMPICILLIN SODIUM 
indications and usage: Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is a treatment for infections caused by certain microorganisms. It is effective against skin and skin structure infections, intra-abdominal infections, and gynecological infections caused by beta-lactamase producing strains of various bacteria. The drug should be used only for the conditions listed, and is also effective against infections caused by ampicillin-susceptible organisms. Before treatment, appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed to identify the organisms causing infection. Therapy may be started before these results are obtained if there is reason to believe the infection may involve any of the listed organisms. Once results are known, therapy should be adjusted if necessary. The drug should only be used to treat infections proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria, to prevent the development of drug-resistant bacteria. If culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered when choosing or modifying therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may guide the selection of therapy. 
dosage and administration: Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection, USP can be administered via IV or IM routes. For IV, the dose can be given slowly over 10-15 minutes or as an infusion over 15-30 minutes. For IM, it should be a deep injection. The recommended adult dosage is 1.5 g to 3 g every six hours, with the total dose of sulbactam not exceeding 4 grams per day. For pediatric patients aged 1 year or older, the recommended daily dose is 300 mg per kg of body weight, given every 6 hours. However, the safety of IM administration in pediatric patients is not established. Pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or more should follow adult dosage recommendations. IV therapy should not exceed 14 days. In patients with impaired renal function, the dosage should be adjusted according to the degree of impairment. The dosage guide is provided in the content for different levels of creatinine clearance. 
contraindications: CONTRAINDICATIONS The use of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is contraindicated in individuals with a history of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis or Stevens-Johnson syndrome) to ampicillin, sulbactam or to other beta-lactam antibacterial drugs (e.g., penicillins and cephalosporins). Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is contraindicated in patients with a previous history of cholestatic jaundice/hepatic dysfunction associated with ampicillin and sulbactam for injection. 
adverse reactions: The injection of Ampicillin and Sulbactam is generally well tolerated in adults. However, some adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials. Local reactions include pain at the injection site and thrombophlebitis. Systemic reactions include diarrhea, rash, itching, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, headache, chest pain, and other less common symptoms. 

In pediatric patients, the adverse events profile is similar to adults, with the addition of atypical lymphocytosis observed in one case. 

Adverse laboratory changes reported during clinical trials include increased liver enzymes, changes in blood cell counts, decreased serum albumin and total proteins, increased BUN and creatinine, and presence of RBC's and hyaline casts in urine. 

Post-marketing experiences have reported additional adverse reactions including blood and lymphatic system disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, general disorders, immune system disorders, nervous system disorders, renal and urinary disorders, respiratory disorders, and skin disorders. 

These reactions are usually reversible upon discontinuation of therapy. Serious and fatal hypersensitivity reactions may occur. To report suspected adverse reactions, contact Meitheal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. or FDA. 
pregnancy: Pregnancy Reproduction studies have been performed in mice, rats, and rabbits at doses up to ten (10) times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to ampicillin and sulbactam for injection. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed (see -PRECAUTIONS-Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions section). 
nursing mothers: Nursing Mothers Low concentrations of ampicillin and sulbactam are excreted in the milk; therefore, caution should be exercised when ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is administered to a nursing woman. 
precautions: Patients with mononucleosis should not be given ampicillin class antibacterials due to the high risk of developing a skin rash. Ampicillin and sulbactam should only be prescribed for bacterial infections, not viral ones, and patients should complete the full course of therapy to prevent bacterial resistance. Diarrhea is a common side effect, and patients should contact their doctor if they develop watery and bloody stools. The drug may interact with probenecid and allopurinol, potentially leading to increased blood levels of ampicillin and sulbactam and an increased incidence of rashes. It should not be mixed with aminoglycosides. High urine concentrations of ampicillin may cause false positive reactions in glucose tests. The drug may also temporarily decrease plasma concentration of certain hormones in pregnant women. Its effects on fertility and during labor and delivery are not fully known. It is excreted in low concentrations in breast milk. The safety and effectiveness of the drug have been established for children over one year old for skin infections, but not for intra-abdominal infections. 
storage and handling: Storage Conditions Prior to reconstitution store at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F); excursions permitted between 15° and 30°C (59° and 86°F).

substance name: DIVALPROEX SODIUM 
indications and usage: Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablet is an anti-epileptic drug used for treating manic episodes related to bipolar disorder, complex partial seizures, simple and complex absence seizures, and for preventing migraine headaches. It is not recommended for acute treatment of migraines. The drug's effectiveness for long-term use in mania has not been proven in controlled clinical trials, so healthcare providers should regularly reassess its usefulness for individual patients. Due to the risk of decreased IQ, neurodevelopmental disorders, neural tube defects, and other major congenital malformations in the fetus, it should not be used by pregnant women or women planning to become pregnant, unless other medications have failed to control symptoms or are unacceptable. It is also contraindicated in women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception. 
dosage and administration: Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets are taken orally and should not be crushed or chewed. The initial dose for mania is 750 mg daily, which can be increased to achieve the desired therapeutic response. For complex partial seizures, the starting dose is 10 to 15 mg/kg/day, which can be increased weekly until optimal response is achieved. For absence seizures, the starting dose is 15 mg/kg/day, which can be increased weekly until seizures are controlled or side effects limit further increases. For migraines, the starting dose is 250 mg twice daily, which can be increased to a maximum of 1,000 mg/day as needed. 

If a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible unless it's almost time for the next dose. Doubling the next dose if one is skipped is not recommended. 

For long-term treatment of mania, there is no data to support the benefits of divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets. However, the safety of long-term use is supported by data from record reviews involving approximately 360 patients treated for more than 3 months. 

For epilepsy, divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets are indicated as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in complex partial seizures in adults and pediatric patients down to the age of 10 years, and in simple and complex absence seizures. 

For elderly patients, the starting dose should be reduced due to a decrease in unbound clearance of valproate and possibly a greater sensitivity to somnolence. The ultimate therapeutic dose should be achieved on the basis of both tolerability and clinical response. 

Patients who experience G.I. irritation may benefit from administration of the drug with food or by slowly building up the dose from an initial low level. 

Patients stabilized on rufinamide before being prescribed valproate should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to a clinically effective dose. 
dosage forms and strengths: 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Tablets: 125 mg, 250 mg and 500 mg ( 3 ) Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets, 125 mg are pink colored, oval shaped, biconvex, enteric coated tablets, imprinted with "L005" (in black ink) on one side and plain on the other side.

5. Bleeding and other hematopoietic disorders: Regular monitoring of platelet counts and coagulation tests is necessary.

6. Hyperammonemia and hyperammonemic encephalopathy: The drug can cause high ammonia levels in the blood, leading to lethargy, vomiting, or changes in mental status.

7. Hypothermia: The drug can cause a drop in body temperature.

8. Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan hypersensitivity reaction: The drug can cause a severe allergic reaction affecting multiple organs.

9. Somnolence in the elderly: The drug can cause drowsiness in elderly patients, and dosage should be increased slowly with regular monitoring.

10. Interaction with Carbapenem Antibiotics: These antibiotics can reduce the effectiveness of the drug, leading to loss of seizure control.

11. Effect on HIV and CMV Viruses Replication: The drug may stimulate the replication of HIV and CMV viruses under certain conditions.

12. Medication Residue in the Stool: There have been rare reports of medication residue in the stool, particularly in patients with shortened GI transit times or diarrhea. 

In all cases, regular monitoring and consultation with a healthcare provider is necessary. 
adverse reactions: The document discusses the adverse reactions to a drug called valproate, used in the treatment of manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder, complex partial seizures, and migraines. The most common side effects (reported in more than 5% of patients) include abdominal pain, blurred vision, memory loss, anorexia, back pain, constipation, depression, diarrhea, dizziness, fever, headache, increased appetite, insomnia, nausea, nervousness, rash, vomiting, weight gain, and weight loss. 

The safety and tolerability of valproate in pediatric patients were found to be similar to those in adults. Serious adverse reactions include hepatic failure, birth defects, decreased IQ following in utero exposure, pancreatitis, hyperammonemic encephalopathy, suicidal behavior and ideation, bleeding and other hematopoietic disorders, hypothermia, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)/multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions. 

In clinical trials, the rates of premature termination due to intolerance were not statistically different between placebo, valproate, and lithium carbonate. Vomiting was the only reaction that was reported by significantly more patients receiving valproate compared to placebo. 

Postmarketing experience has identified additional adverse reactions including changes in hair texture and color, emotional upset, psychosis, aggression, fractures, decreased bone mineral density, irregular menses, weight gain, hearing loss, and allergic reactions. 
pregnancy: The content discusses the risks associated with the use of the antiepileptic drug, divalproex sodium, during pregnancy. There is a registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to this drug. Pregnant women are encouraged to enroll in this registry. 

The drug is contraindicated for use in pregnant women and women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception, especially for the prophylaxis of migraine headaches. For epilepsy or bipolar disorder, it should only be used if other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control. 

The use of this drug during pregnancy increases the risk of congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects, and other body system malformations. It may also result in hearing impairment or hearing loss in the baby. The risk of major structural abnormalities is greatest during the first trimester. 

Children exposed to this drug in utero have lower IQ scores and a higher risk of neurodevelopmental disorders compared to children exposed to either another antiepileptic drug in utero or to no antiepileptic drugs in utero. 

Pregnant women taking this drug may develop hepatic failure or clotting abnormalities, which may result in hemorrhagic complications in the neonate, including death. 

Folic acid supplementation prior to conception and during the first trimester of pregnancy is recommended for patients using this drug, although it is not known whether this reduces the risk of neural tube defects or decreased IQ in the offspring. 

The use of this drug during pregnancy should be carefully considered and monitored due to the associated risks. 
nursing mothers: 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception while taking valproate [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 ), and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . This is especially important when valproate use is considered for a condition not usually associated with permanent injury or death such as prophylaxis of migraine headaches [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Infertility There have been reports of male infertility coincident with valproate therapy [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.4 )] . In animal studies, oral administration of valproate at clinically relevant doses resulted in adverse reproductive effects in males [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 
information for patients: This is a patient counseling information guide for a medication called valproate. It advises patients to be aware of potential side effects such as hepatotoxicity and pancreatitis, which can cause symptoms like nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and anorexia. It also warns of the risk of birth defects and decreased IQ in children if the drug is used during pregnancy. Women are advised to use effective contraception while taking valproate and to discuss pregnancy planning with their doctor. 

The guide also warns of the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior, hyperammonemic encephalopathy, CNS depression, and multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions. Patients are advised to report any concerning symptoms to their healthcare provider immediately. 

The medication may cause drowsiness, especially when combined with other CNS depressants like alcohol, so patients are advised not to engage in hazardous activities until they know how the drug affects them. 

Patients are also advised to report if they notice medication residue in their stool. The medication is manufactured by Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Lupin Limited. 
substance name: ALPRAZOLAM 
indications and usage: 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Alprazolam tablets are indicated for the: • acute treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in adults. • treatment of panic disorder (PD), with or without agoraphobia in adults. Alprazolam tablets are a benzodiazepine indicated for the: • Acute treatment of generalized anxiety disorder in adults. ( 1 ) • Treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults. ( 1 ) 
dosage and administration: The document provides dosage and administration guidelines for alprazolam, a medication used to treat generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and panic disorder (PD). 

For GAD, the starting dosage is 0.25 mg to 0.5 mg three times daily, which can be increased every 3 to 4 days to a maximum of 4 mg daily. The lowest effective dose should be used and the need for continued treatment should be frequently assessed.

For PD, the starting dosage is 0.5 mg three times daily, which can be increased every 3 to 4 days by no more than 1 mg per day. For patients receiving doses greater than 4 mg per day, periodic reassessment and consideration of dosage reduction is advised.

When tapering off alprazolam, the dosage should be decreased by no more than 0.5 mg every 3 days. If withdrawal reactions occur, the taper may need to be paused or the dosage increased to the previous level, then decreased more slowly.

For geriatric patients and those with hepatic impairment, the starting dosage is 0.25 mg, given 2 or 3 times daily, which can be gradually increased if needed and tolerated. If adverse reactions occur, the dosage may be reduced.

When alprazolam is used with ritonavir, the dosage should be reduced to half of the recommended dosage and then increased to the target dose after 10 to 14 days. Alprazolam is contraindicated with concomitant use of all strong CYP3A inhibitors, except ritonavir. 
dosage forms and strengths: 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Alprazolam tablets are available as: • 0.25 mg: white, oval, debossed “GG 256” on one side and scored on the reverse side • 0.5 mg: peach, oval, debossed “GG 257” on one side and scored on the reverse side • 1 mg: blue, oval, debossed “GG 258” on one side and scored on the reverse side • 2 mg: white, rectangular, multi-scored, debossed “GG 249” on one side and plain on the reverse side Tablets: 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, and 2 mg ( 3 ) 
contraindications: 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Alprazolam is contraindicated in patients: • with known hypersensitivity to alprazolam or other benzodiazepines. Angioedema has been reported [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . • taking strong cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole), except ritonavir [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] • Known hypersensitivity to alprazolam or other benzodiazepines. ( 4 ) • Concomitant use with strong cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) inhibitors, except ritonavir. ( 4 , 5.5 , 7.1 ) 
warnings and cautions: The content provides warnings and precautions for the use of alprazolam, a medication often used to treat anxiety and panic disorders. Key points include:

1. Alprazolam can impair driving and operating machinery. Patients should avoid alcohol and other central nervous system depressants while on this medication.
2. Patients with depression should be closely monitored while on alprazolam. The least number of tablets should be prescribed to avoid intentional overdosage.
3. Alprazolam use during pregnancy can lead to neonatal sedation and withdrawal syndrome.
4. The combined use of alprazolam and opioids can lead to severe sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and even death. If these drugs are prescribed together, the lowest effective dosages should be used.
5. Alprazolam can lead to abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can result in overdose or death. Patients should be assessed for these risks before and during treatment.
6. Discontinuing alprazolam abruptly or reducing the dosage rapidly can lead to withdrawal reactions, some of which can be life-threatening.
7. Alprazolam can interact with drugs that inhibit its metabolism, potentially affecting its clearance from the body.
8. Alprazolam may worsen depression and has been associated with episodes of hypomania and mania.
9. Late pregnancy use of alprazolam can result in neonatal sedation and withdrawal symptoms.
10. Patients with impaired respiratory function should be closely monitored while on alprazolam, as there have been reports of death in such patients shortly after starting the medication. 
adverse reactions: The document discusses the adverse reactions associated with the use of a drug, presumably alprazolam. These reactions are categorized into those identified during clinical trials and those reported post-approval. 

In clinical trials, common adverse reactions for generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder included impaired coordination, hypotension, dysarthria, and increased libido. Other reactions were also reported, such as drowsiness, light-headedness, dizziness, dry mouth, increased salivation, hypotension, dermatitis/allergy, and various other symptoms. 

In postmarketing experience, adverse reactions included hyperprolactinemia, peripheral edema, hepatitis, hepatic failure, liver enzyme elevations, hypomania, mania, gynecomastia, galactorrhea, photosensitivity reaction, angioedema, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. 

The document also mentions risks associated with concomitant use with opioids, abuse, misuse, addiction, dependence and withdrawal reactions, effects on driving and operating machinery, patients with depression, neonatal sedation and withdrawal syndrome, and risks in patients with impaired respiratory function. 

Adverse reactions were also reported as reasons for discontinuation of treatment, including insomnia, light-headedness, abnormal involuntary movement, headache, muscular twitching, impaired coordination, muscle tone disorders, weakness, and various other symptoms. 

The document advises that alprazolam should be discontinued if any of these adverse events occur. It also notes that patients with certain conditions, such as borderline personality disorder, a history of violent or aggressive behavior, or alcohol or substance abuse, may be at higher risk for adverse events. 
pregnancy: There is a registry that tracks pregnancy outcomes in women who have been exposed to psychiatric medications, including alprazolam. Healthcare providers are urged to register patients in this registry. Babies born to mothers who used benzodiazepines late in pregnancy may experience symptoms of sedation and/or withdrawal. However, available data does not clearly link benzodiazepines to major birth defects. All pregnancies carry a risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the general U.S. population, the estimated risk of major birth defects is 2% to 4% and miscarriage is 15% to 20%. Benzodiazepines can cross the placenta and may cause respiratory depression, hypotonia, and sedation in newborns. Newborns exposed to alprazolam during pregnancy should be monitored for these symptoms and for signs of withdrawal. Despite early studies suggesting an increased risk of congenital malformations with certain benzodiazepines, recent studies have not confirmed these findings. 
storage and handling: Store at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature]. Dispense contents in a tight, light-resistant container as defined in the USP with a child-resistant closure. KEEP OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN. 
information for patients: Patients should be advised to read the FDA-approved patient labeling. They should be warned about the risks of using alprazolam with opioids, including potentially fatal respiratory depression and sedation. Patients should not drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of the drug combination are known. 

Patients should be informed about the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction associated with alprazolam, even at recommended dosages. They should be educated about the signs and symptoms of benzodiazepine abuse and addiction, and advised to seek medical help if these symptoms develop.

Patients should be warned about withdrawal reactions that can occur with continued use of alprazolam and the potential for a protracted withdrawal syndrome. They should be advised that discontinuation or dosage reduction may require a slow taper.

Patients should be advised not to drive or operate heavy machinery while taking alprazolam due to its CNS depressant effects. They should also avoid alcohol or other CNS depressants.

Patients with depression should be monitored for signs of suicidality or worsening depression. They should be advised to inform their healthcare provider of all medicines they take, including prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, and herbal supplements.

Pregnant women should be advised that use of alprazolam late in pregnancy can result in sedation and/or withdrawal symptoms in newborns. They should be informed about the pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to alprazolam during pregnancy.

Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with alprazolam. For the most recent prescribing information, patients should visit www.sandoz.com.

For sedation, 12.5 to 25 mg can be given to children and 25 to 50 mg to adults at bedtime. Before surgery, 12.5 to 25 mg can be given to children and 50 mg to adults to relieve anxiety and induce sleep. After surgery, 12.5 to 25 mg can be given to children and 25 to 50 mg to adults for sedation and pain relief. 
contraindications: CONTRAINDICATIONS Promethazine hydrochloride tablets, USP are contraindicated for use in pediatric patients less than two years of age. Promethazine hydrochloride tablets, USP are contraindicated in comatose states, and in individuals known to be hypersensitive or to have had an idiosyncratic reaction to promethazine or to other phenothiazines. Antihistamines are contraindicated for use in the treatment of lower respiratory tract symptoms including asthma. 
adverse reactions: The drug in question can cause a variety of adverse reactions. The most common effect on the central nervous system is drowsiness, but it can also cause sedation, blurred vision, dizziness, confusion, disorientation, and various other symptoms. Hallucinations have been reported as well. Cardiovascular effects can include changes in blood pressure and heart rate, as well as faintness. Dermatologic reactions can include dermatitis, photosensitivity, and urticaria. Hematologic reactions can include leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and agranulocytosis. Gastrointestinal reactions can include dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice. Respiratory reactions can include asthma, nasal stuffiness, and potentially fatal respiratory depression and apnea. Other reactions can include angioneurotic edema and potentially fatal neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Hyperexcitability and abnormal movements have been reported after a single dose. If these occur, discontinuation of the drug and use of other drugs should be considered. Respiratory depression, nightmares, delirium, and agitated behavior have also been reported in some patients. 
pregnancy: Promethazine hydrochloride, a drug classified under Pregnancy Category C, has not shown teratogenic (harmful to fetus) effects in rat studies at certain doses. However, higher daily doses have resulted in fetal mortality in rats. No specific studies have been conducted on the drug's impact on childbirth, lactation, and neonatal development, but preliminary studies suggest no effect. The drug's effects in rodents do not necessarily reflect its effects in humans. There are no comprehensive studies on the use of promethazine hydrochloride tablets in pregnant women. Therefore, they should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the fetus. Additionally, administering these tablets to a pregnant woman close to delivery may inhibit platelet aggregation in the newborn. 
nursing mothers: Nursing Mothers It is not known whether promethazine hydrochloride is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from promethazine hydrochloride tablets, USP a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 
precautions: Promethazine hydrochloride tablets should be used with caution in patients with certain conditions such as narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, and liver function impairment. The drug may cause drowsiness and impair mental and physical abilities, potentially affecting tasks like driving or operating machinery. It can also interact with other central-nervous-system depressants, potentially enhancing impairment. 

Patients should avoid prolonged sun exposure and report any involuntary muscle movements. The drug may also affect certain laboratory tests, including pregnancy tests and glucose tolerance tests. 

There is no conclusive data on the drug's potential carcinogenic effects, mutagenicity, or impairment of fertility. It should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus. 

The drug may inhibit platelet aggregation in newborns if administered to a pregnant woman within two weeks of delivery. It is unknown whether the drug is excreted in human milk, so a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or the drug. 

The drug is not recommended for use in children under two years of age and should be used with caution in children over two years of age. Elderly patients should start with low doses due to the potential for confusion and over-sedation. 
information for patients: Information for Patients Promethazine hydrochloride tablets, USP may cause marked drowsiness or impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery. The use of alcohol or other central-nervous-system depressants such as sedatives/hypnotics (including barbiturates), narcotics, narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, tricyclic antidepressants, and tranquilizers, may enhance impairment ( see WARNINGS-CNS Depression and PRECAUTIONS-Drug Interactions ). Pediatric patients should be supervised to avoid potential harm in bike riding or in other hazardous activities. Patients should be advised to report any involuntary muscle movements. Avoid prolonged exposure to the sun.

warnings and cautions: The content discusses the warnings and precautions for using LUMOXITI, a treatment for Hairy Cell Leukemia (HCL). 

1. Renal Toxicity: Monitor renal function before each infusion and delay dosing until recovery if necessary. 

2. Infusion Related Reactions: Pre-medicate before each dose and interrupt the infusion if a severe reaction occurs. 

3. Electrolyte Abnormalities: Monitor serum electrolytes before each dose and on Day 8 of each treatment cycle. 

4. Capillary Leak Syndrome (CLS): Monitor patient weight and blood pressure before each infusion and assess for signs and symptoms of CLS. Delay or discontinue treatment if necessary. 

5. Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS): Avoid LUMOXITI in patients with a history of severe thrombotic microangiopathy or HUS. Monitor blood chemistry and complete blood counts before each dose. Discontinue LUMOXITI in patients with HUS. 

6. Renal Toxicity: Monitor renal function before each infusion and delay dosing in patients with Grade ≥ 3 elevations in creatinine. 

7. Infusion Related Reactions: Pre-medicate with antihistamines and antipyretics before each dose. Interrupt the infusion and administer a corticosteroid if a severe reaction occurs. 

8. Electrolyte Abnormalities: Monitor serum electrolytes before each dose and on Day 8 of each treatment cycle. 

In summary, the use of LUMOXITI requires careful monitoring of renal function, electrolyte levels, and patient symptoms to manage potential side effects and reactions. 
adverse reactions: The document discusses the adverse reactions and clinical trial experiences related to the drug LUMOXITI, used for treating Hairy Cell Leukemia (HCL). The most common adverse reactions include infusion-related reactions, edema, nausea, fatigue, headache, fever, constipation, anemia, and diarrhea. Laboratory abnormalities such as increased creatinine and ALT, hypoalbuminemia, increased AST, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia were also common. 

The clinical trial involved 80 patients with previously treated HCL. They received LUMOXITI as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes on specific days of each 28-day cycle for a maximum of 6 cycles. The median duration of treatment was 5.7 months. 

Adverse reactions led to the discontinuation of LUMOXITI in 15% of patients, with Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) being the most common reason. The most common reaction causing dose delays or interruptions was fever. 

The document also discusses the potential for immunogenicity with all therapeutic proteins. In the study, 59% of patients tested positive for anti-moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk antibodies (ADA) before any treatment. Patients who tested positive for ADA had decreased systemic moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk concentrations. 
pregnancy: 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action and findings in non-pregnant female animals, LUMOXITI is expected to cause maternal and embryo-fetal toxicity when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ] . There are no available data on LUMOXITI use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. Animal reproduction or developmental toxicity studies have not been conducted with LUMOXITI. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. 
information for patients: Patients should read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide) for LUMOXITI, a medication manufactured by AstraZeneca. They should be aware of the risk of developing capillary leak syndrome and hemolytic uremic syndrome, and report any related symptoms to their healthcare provider immediately. Patients should also maintain high fluid intake and have frequent blood chemistry checks. LUMOXITI may cause decreased renal function, so any changes in urine output should be reported. Patients should also contact their healthcare provider if they experience symptoms of infusion related reactions or electrolyte abnormalities. The medication is distributed by AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP and manufactured by AstraZeneca AB.

4. Increased seizure frequency: This may occur if gabapentin is abruptly discontinued in patients with seizure disorders.
5. Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Patients should be monitored for suicidal thoughts/behavior.
6. Respiratory Depression: This may occur when gabapentin is used with other central nervous system depressants or in patients with underlying respiratory impairment.
7. Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions in Children 3 to 12 Years of Age: Children should be monitored for such events.
8. Tumorigenic Potential: Gabapentin increased the incidence of pancreatic acinar cell tumors in rats, but the clinical significance of this finding is unknown.
9. Sudden and Unexplained Death in Patients with Epilepsy: There were 8 sudden and unexplained deaths recorded among a cohort of 2203 epilepsy patients treated with gabapentin during premarketing development. 
adverse reactions: The document discusses the adverse reactions associated with a drug, with specific sections detailing reactions in different age groups and conditions. Serious reactions include Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), Anaphylaxis, Angioedema, Somnolence/Sedation, Dizziness, Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus, Suicidal Behavior and Ideation, Respiratory Depression, Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions, and Sudden and Unexplained Death in Patients with Epilepsy. 

Common reactions include dizziness, somnolence, peripheral edema, ataxia, fatigue, nystagmus, viral infection, fever, nausea, vomiting, and hostility. Adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in some cases. 

The document also provides information on how to report suspected adverse reactions and discusses the limitations of clinical trials in predicting adverse reaction rates in the general population. 

Postherpetic neuralgia and epilepsy patients experienced different adverse reactions. In postherpetic neuralgia patients, the most common reactions were dizziness, somnolence, and peripheral edema. In epilepsy patients, reactions varied by age. 

Adverse reactions were also reported postmarketing, including hepatobiliary disorders, elevated creatine kinase, elevated liver function tests, hyponatremia, rhabdomyolysis, movement disorder, psychiatric disorders, reproductive system and breast disorders, and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. Life-threatening or fatal respiratory depression has been reported in patients taking the drug with opioids or other CNS depressants, or in those with underlying respiratory impairment. Abrupt discontinuation of the drug has also been associated with adverse reactions. 
pregnancy: A pregnancy exposure registry monitors the outcomes of pregnancies in women who have taken antiepileptic drugs like gabapentin. Women taking gabapentin during pregnancy are encouraged to register with the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. There is insufficient data on the developmental risks of using gabapentin during pregnancy. Nonclinical studies on animals have shown developmental toxicity when gabapentin was administered to pregnant animals. In the general U.S. population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% respectively. The risk for the population indicated is unknown. Animal data shows embryofetal toxicity in mice and adverse effects on offspring development in rats when given gabapentin during pregnancy. Increased embryofetal mortality was observed in rabbits. A study showed that gabapentin caused a significant decrease in neuronal synapse formation in mice. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. 
nursing mothers: 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Gabapentin is secreted in human milk following oral administration. The effects on the breastfed infant and on milk production are unknown. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for gabapentin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from gabapentin or from the underlying maternal condition. 
information for patients: This is patient counseling information for the drug gabapentin. Patients should be aware that:

1. Gabapentin can be taken orally with or without food.
2. Before starting gabapentin, patients should be informed that a rash or other signs of hypersensitivity could indicate a serious medical event. They should report any such symptoms to a doctor immediately.
3. If patients develop signs of anaphylaxis or angioedema, they should stop taking gabapentin and seek medical care.
4. Gabapentin may cause dizziness, somnolence, and other symptoms of CNS depression. Patients should avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until they know how gabapentin affects them.
5. Gabapentin, like other AEDs, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Patients should be alert for worsening depression, changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts.
6. Gabapentin may cause respiratory depression, especially in those using other CNS depressants or those with underlying respiratory impairment. Patients should seek medical attention immediately if this occurs.
7. If patients become pregnant or plan to breastfeed, they should inform their doctor. They are also encouraged to enroll in the NAAED Pregnancy Registry, which collects information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy.

substance name: AMPICILLIN SODIUM 
indications and usage: Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is a treatment for infections caused by certain microorganisms. It is effective against skin and skin structure infections, intra-abdominal infections, and gynecological infections caused by beta-lactamase producing strains of various bacteria. The drug should be used only for the conditions listed, and is also effective against infections caused by ampicillin-susceptible organisms. Before treatment, appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed to identify the organisms causing infection. Therapy may be started before these results are obtained if there is reason to believe the infection may involve any of the listed organisms. Once results are known, therapy should be adjusted if necessary. The drug should only be used to treat infections proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria, to prevent the development of drug-resistant bacteria. If culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered when choosing or modifying therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may guide the selection of therapy. 
dosage and administration: Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection, USP can be administered via IV or IM routes. For IV, the dose can be given slowly over 10-15 minutes or as an infusion over 15-30 minutes. For IM, it should be a deep injection. The recommended adult dosage is 1.5 g to 3 g every six hours, with the total dose of sulbactam not exceeding 4 grams per day. For pediatric patients aged 1 year or older, the recommended daily dose is 300 mg per kg of body weight, given every 6 hours. However, the safety of IM administration in pediatric patients is not established. Pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or more should follow adult dosage recommendations. IV therapy should not exceed 14 days. In patients with impaired renal function, the dosage should be adjusted according to the degree of impairment. The dosage guide is provided in the content for different levels of creatinine clearance. 
contraindications: CONTRAINDICATIONS The use of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is contraindicated in individuals with a history of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis or Stevens-Johnson syndrome) to ampicillin, sulbactam or to other beta-lactam antibacterial drugs (e.g., penicillins and cephalosporins). Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is contraindicated in patients with a previous history of cholestatic jaundice/hepatic dysfunction associated with ampicillin and sulbactam for injection. 
adverse reactions: The injection of Ampicillin and Sulbactam is generally well tolerated in adults. However, some adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials. Local reactions include pain at the injection site and thrombophlebitis. Systemic reactions include diarrhea, rash, itching, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, headache, chest pain, and other less common symptoms. 

In pediatric patients, the adverse events profile is similar to adults, with the addition of atypical lymphocytosis observed in one case. 

Adverse laboratory changes reported during clinical trials include increased liver enzymes, changes in blood cell counts, decreased serum albumin and total proteins, increased BUN and creatinine, and presence of RBC's and hyaline casts in urine. 

Post-marketing experiences have reported additional adverse reactions including blood and lymphatic system disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, general disorders, immune system disorders, nervous system disorders, renal and urinary disorders, respiratory disorders, and skin disorders. 

These reactions are usually reversible upon discontinuation of therapy. Serious and fatal hypersensitivity reactions may occur. To report suspected adverse reactions, contact Meitheal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. or FDA. 
pregnancy: Pregnancy Reproduction studies have been performed in mice, rats, and rabbits at doses up to ten (10) times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to ampicillin and sulbactam for injection. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed (see -PRECAUTIONS-Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions section). 
nursing mothers: Nursing Mothers Low concentrations of ampicillin and sulbactam are excreted in the milk; therefore, caution should be exercised when ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is administered to a nursing woman. 
precautions: Patients with mononucleosis should not be given ampicillin class antibacterials due to the high risk of developing a skin rash. Ampicillin and sulbactam should only be prescribed for bacterial infections, not viral ones, and patients should complete the full course of therapy to prevent bacterial resistance. Diarrhea is a common side effect, and patients should contact their doctor if they develop watery and bloody stools. The drug may interact with probenecid and allopurinol, potentially leading to increased blood levels of ampicillin and sulbactam and an increased incidence of rashes. It should not be mixed with aminoglycosides. High urine concentrations of ampicillin may cause false positive reactions in glucose tests. The drug may also temporarily decrease plasma concentration of certain hormones in pregnant women. Its effects on fertility and during labor and delivery are not fully known. It is excreted in low concentrations in breast milk. The safety and effectiveness of the drug have been established for children over one year old for skin infections, but not for intra-abdominal infections. 
storage and handling: Storage Conditions Prior to reconstitution store at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F); excursions permitted between 15° and 30°C (59° and 86°F).

substance name: DIVALPROEX SODIUM 
indications and usage: Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablet is an anti-epileptic drug used for treating manic episodes related to bipolar disorder, complex partial seizures, simple and complex absence seizures, and for preventing migraine headaches. It is not recommended for acute treatment of migraines. The drug's effectiveness for long-term use in mania has not been proven in controlled clinical trials, so healthcare providers should regularly reassess its usefulness for individual patients. Due to the risk of decreased IQ, neurodevelopmental disorders, neural tube defects, and other major congenital malformations in the fetus, it should not be used by pregnant women or women planning to become pregnant, unless other medications have failed to control symptoms or are unacceptable. It is also contraindicated in women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception. 
dosage and administration: Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets are taken orally and should not be crushed or chewed. The initial dose for mania is 750 mg daily, which can be increased to achieve the desired therapeutic response. For complex partial seizures, the starting dose is 10 to 15 mg/kg/day, which can be increased weekly until optimal response is achieved. For absence seizures, the starting dose is 15 mg/kg/day, which can be increased weekly until seizures are controlled or side effects limit further increases. For migraines, the starting dose is 250 mg twice daily, which can be increased to a maximum of 1,000 mg/day as needed. 

If a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible unless it's almost time for the next dose. Doubling the next dose if one is skipped is not recommended. 

For long-term treatment of mania, there is no data to support the benefits of divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets. However, the safety of long-term use is supported by data from record reviews involving approximately 360 patients treated for more than 3 months. 

For epilepsy, divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets are indicated as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in complex partial seizures in adults and pediatric patients down to the age of 10 years, and in simple and complex absence seizures. 

For elderly patients, the starting dose should be reduced due to a decrease in unbound clearance of valproate and possibly a greater sensitivity to somnolence. The ultimate therapeutic dose should be achieved on the basis of both tolerability and clinical response. 

Patients who experience G.I. irritation may benefit from administration of the drug with food or by slowly building up the dose from an initial low level. 

Patients stabilized on rufinamide before being prescribed valproate should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to a clinically effective dose. 
dosage forms and strengths: 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Tablets: 125 mg, 250 mg and 500 mg ( 3 ) Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets, 125 mg are pink colored, oval shaped, biconvex, enteric coated tablets, imprinted with "L005" (in black ink) on one side and plain on the other side. Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets, 250 mg are pink colored, oval shaped, biconvex, enteric coated tablets, imprinted with "L006" (in black ink) on one side and plain on the other side. Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets, 500 mg are pink colored, oval shaped, biconvex, enteric coated tablets, imprinted with "L007" (in black ink) on one side and plain on the other side. 
contraindications: The use of Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets is contraindicated in the following cases:

1. Patients with hepatic disease or significant hepatic dysfunction.
2. Patients with known mitochondrial disorders caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ (POLG), such as Alpers-Huttenlocher Syndrome.
3. Children under two years of age suspected of having a POLG-related disorder.
4. Patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug.
5. Patients with known urea cycle disorders.
6. For the prevention of migraine headaches, the drug is contraindicated in pregnant women and women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception. 
warnings and cautions: The content provided is a detailed list of warnings and precautions for the use of Divalproex Sodium, a medication used to treat certain types of seizures and manic episodes related to bipolar disorder. 

Key points include:

1. Hepatotoxicity: The drug can cause liver damage. Regular monitoring of liver function is necessary, especially in high-risk populations.

2. Birth defects and neurodevelopmental disorders: The drug should not be used in pregnant women or women planning to become pregnant due to the risk of birth defects and decreased IQ in children exposed to the drug in utero.

3. Pancreatitis: The drug can cause pancreatitis and should be discontinued if this occurs.

4. Suicidal behavior or ideation: The drug can increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior.

5. Bleeding and other hematopoietic disorders: Regular monitoring of platelet counts and coagulation tests is necessary.

6. Hyperammonemia and hyperammonemic encephalopathy: The drug can cause high ammonia levels in the blood, leading to lethargy, vomiting, or changes in mental status.

7. Hypothermia: The drug can cause a drop in body temperature.

8. Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan hypersensitivity reaction: The drug can cause a severe allergic reaction affecting multiple organs.

9. Somnolence in the elderly: The drug can cause drowsiness in elderly patients, and dosage should be increased slowly with regular monitoring.

10. Interaction with Carbapenem Antibiotics: These antibiotics can reduce the effectiveness of the drug, leading to loss of seizure control.

11. Effect on HIV and CMV Viruses Replication: The drug may stimulate the replication of HIV and CMV viruses under certain conditions.

12. Medication Residue in the Stool: There have been rare reports of medication residue in the stool, particularly in patients with shortened GI transit times or diarrhea. 

In all cases, regular monitoring and consultation with a healthcare provider is necessary. 
adverse reactions: The document discusses the adverse reactions to a drug called valproate, used in the treatment of manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder, complex partial seizures, and migraines. The most common side effects (reported in more than 5% of patients) include abdominal pain, blurred vision, memory loss, anorexia, back pain, constipation, depression, diarrhea, dizziness, fever, headache, increased appetite, insomnia, nausea, nervousness, rash, vomiting, weight gain, and weight loss. 

The safety and tolerability of valproate in pediatric patients were found to be similar to those in adults. Serious adverse reactions include hepatic failure, birth defects, decreased IQ following in utero exposure, pancreatitis, hyperammonemic encephalopathy, suicidal behavior and ideation, bleeding and other hematopoietic disorders, hypothermia, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)/multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions. 

In clinical trials, the rates of premature termination due to intolerance were not statistically different between placebo, valproate, and lithium carbonate. Vomiting was the only reaction that was reported by significantly more patients receiving valproate compared to placebo. 

Postmarketing experience has identified additional adverse reactions including changes in hair texture and color, emotional upset, psychosis, aggression, fractures, decreased bone mineral density, irregular menses, weight gain, hearing loss, and allergic reactions. 
pregnancy: The content discusses the risks associated with the use of the antiepileptic drug, divalproex sodium, during pregnancy. There is a registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to this drug. Pregnant women are encouraged to enroll in this registry. 

The drug is contraindicated for use in pregnant women and women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception, especially for the prophylaxis of migraine headaches. For epilepsy or bipolar disorder, it should only be used if other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control. 

The use of this drug during pregnancy increases the risk of congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects, and other body system malformations. It may also result in hearing impairment or hearing loss in the baby. The risk of major structural abnormalities is greatest during the first trimester. 

Children exposed to this drug in utero have lower IQ scores and a higher risk of neurodevelopmental disorders compared to children exposed to either another antiepileptic drug in utero or to no antiepileptic drugs in utero. 

Pregnant women taking this drug may develop hepatic failure or clotting abnormalities, which may result in hemorrhagic complications in the neonate, including death. 

Folic acid supplementation prior to conception and during the first trimester of pregnancy is recommended for patients using this drug, although it is not known whether this reduces the risk of neural tube defects or decreased IQ in the offspring. 

The use of this drug during pregnancy should be carefully considered and monitored due to the associated risks. 
nursing mothers: 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception while taking valproate [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 ), and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . This is especially important when valproate use is considered for a condition not usually associated with permanent injury or death such as prophylaxis of migraine headaches [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Infertility There have been reports of male infertility coincident with valproate therapy [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.4 )] . In animal studies, oral administration of valproate at clinically relevant doses resulted in adverse reproductive effects in males [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 
information for patients: This is a patient counseling information guide for a medication called valproate. It advises patients to be aware of potential side effects such as hepatotoxicity and pancreatitis, which can cause symptoms like nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and anorexia. It also warns of the risk of birth defects and decreased IQ in children if the drug is used during pregnancy. Women are advised to use effective contraception while taking valproate and to discuss pregnancy planning with their doctor. 

The guide also warns of the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior, hyperammonemic encephalopathy, CNS depression, and multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions. Patients are advised to report any concerning symptoms to their healthcare provider immediately. 

The medication may cause drowsiness, especially when combined with other CNS depressants like alcohol, so patients are advised not to engage in hazardous activities until they know how the drug affects them. 

Patients are also advised to report if they notice medication residue in their stool. The medication is manufactured by Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Lupin Limited. 
substance name: ALPRAZOLAM 
indications and usage: 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Alprazolam tablets are indicated for the: • acute treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in adults. • treatment of panic disorder (PD), with or without agoraphobia in adults. Alprazolam tablets are a benzodiazepine indicated for the: • Acute treatment of generalized anxiety disorder in adults. ( 1 ) • Treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults. ( 1 ) 
dosage and administration: The document provides dosage and administration guidelines for alprazolam, a medication used to treat generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and panic disorder (PD). 

For GAD, the starting dosage is 0.25 mg to 0.5 mg three times daily, which can be increased every 3 to 4 days to a maximum of 4 mg daily. The lowest effective dose should be used and the need for continued treatment should be frequently assessed.

For PD, the starting dosage is 0.5 mg three times daily, which can be increased every 3 to 4 days by no more than 1 mg per day. For patients receiving doses greater than 4 mg per day, periodic reassessment and consideration of dosage reduction is advised.

When tapering off alprazolam, the dosage should be decreased by no more than 0.5 mg every 3 days. If withdrawal reactions occur, the taper may need to be paused or the dosage increased to the previous level, then decreased more slowly.

For geriatric patients and those with hepatic impairment, the starting dosage is 0.25 mg, given 2 or 3 times daily, which can be gradually increased if needed and tolerated. If adverse reactions occur, the dosage may be reduced.

When alprazolam is used with ritonavir, the dosage should be reduced to half of the recommended dosage and then increased to the target dose after 10 to 14 days. Alprazolam is contraindicated with concomitant use of all strong CYP3A inhibitors, except ritonavir. 
dosage forms and strengths: 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Alprazolam tablets are available as: • 0.25 mg: white, oval, debossed “GG 256” on one side and scored on the reverse side • 0.5 mg: peach, oval, debossed “GG 257” on one side and scored on the reverse side • 1 mg: blue, oval, debossed “GG 258” on one side and scored on the reverse side • 2 mg: white, rectangular, multi-scored, debossed “GG 249” on one side and plain on the reverse side Tablets: 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, and 2 mg ( 3 ) 
contraindications: 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Alprazolam is contraindicated in patients: • with known hypersensitivity to alprazolam or other benzodiazepines. Angioedema has been reported [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . • taking strong cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole), except ritonavir [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] • Known hypersensitivity to alprazolam or other benzodiazepines. ( 4 ) • Concomitant use with strong cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) inhibitors, except ritonavir. ( 4 , 5.5 , 7.1 ) 
warnings and cautions: The content provides warnings and precautions for the use of alprazolam, a medication often used to treat anxiety and panic disorders. Key points include:

1. Alprazolam can impair driving and operating machinery. Patients should avoid alcohol and other central nervous system depressants while on this medication.
2. Patients with depression should be closely monitored while on alprazolam. The least number of tablets should be prescribed to avoid intentional overdosage.
3. Alprazolam use during pregnancy can lead to neonatal sedation and withdrawal syndrome.
4. The combined use of alprazolam and opioids can lead to severe sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and even death. If these drugs are prescribed together, the lowest effective dosages should be used.
5. Alprazolam can lead to abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can result in overdose or death. Patients should be assessed for these risks before and during treatment.
6. Discontinuing alprazolam abruptly or reducing the dosage rapidly can lead to withdrawal reactions, some of which can be life-threatening.
7. Alprazolam can interact with drugs that inhibit its metabolism, potentially affecting its clearance from the body.
8. Alprazolam may worsen depression and has been associated with episodes of hypomania and mania.
9. Late pregnancy use of alprazolam can result in neonatal sedation and withdrawal symptoms.
10. Patients with impaired respiratory function should be closely monitored while on alprazolam, as there have been reports of death in such patients shortly after starting the medication. 
adverse reactions: The document discusses the adverse reactions associated with the use of a drug, presumably alprazolam. These reactions are categorized into those identified during clinical trials and those reported post-approval. 

In clinical trials, common adverse reactions for generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder included impaired coordination, hypotension, dysarthria, and increased libido. Other reactions were also reported, such as drowsiness, light-headedness, dizziness, dry mouth, increased salivation, hypotension, dermatitis/allergy, and various other symptoms. 

In postmarketing experience, adverse reactions included hyperprolactinemia, peripheral edema, hepatitis, hepatic failure, liver enzyme elevations, hypomania, mania, gynecomastia, galactorrhea, photosensitivity reaction, angioedema, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. 

The document also mentions risks associated with concomitant use with opioids, abuse, misuse, addiction, dependence and withdrawal reactions, effects on driving and operating machinery, patients with depression, neonatal sedation and withdrawal syndrome, and risks in patients with impaired respiratory function. 

Adverse reactions were also reported as reasons for discontinuation of treatment, including insomnia, light-headedness, abnormal involuntary movement, headache, muscular twitching, impaired coordination, muscle tone disorders, weakness, and various other symptoms. 

The document advises that alprazolam should be discontinued if any of these adverse events occur. It also notes that patients with certain conditions, such as borderline personality disorder, a history of violent or aggressive behavior, or alcohol or substance abuse, may be at higher risk for adverse events. 
pregnancy: There is a registry that tracks pregnancy outcomes in women who have been exposed to psychiatric medications, including alprazolam. Healthcare providers are urged to register patients in this registry. Babies born to mothers who used benzodiazepines late in pregnancy may experience symptoms of sedation and/or withdrawal. However, available data does not clearly link benzodiazepines to major birth defects. All pregnancies carry a risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the general U.S. population, the estimated risk of major birth defects is 2% to 4% and miscarriage is 15% to 20%. Benzodiazepines can cross the placenta and may cause respiratory depression, hypotonia, and sedation in newborns. Newborns exposed to alprazolam during pregnancy should be monitored for these symptoms and for signs of withdrawal. Despite early studies suggesting an increased risk of congenital malformations with certain benzodiazepines, recent studies have not confirmed these findings. 
storage and handling: Store at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature]. Dispense contents in a tight, light-resistant container as defined in the USP with a child-resistant closure. KEEP OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN. 
information for patients: Patients should be advised to read the FDA-approved patient labeling. They should be warned about the risks of using alprazolam with opioids, including potentially fatal respiratory depression and sedation. Patients should not drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of the drug combination are known. 

Patients should be informed about the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction associated with alprazolam, even at recommended dosages. They should be educated about the signs and symptoms of benzodiazepine abuse and addiction, and advised to seek medical help if these symptoms develop.

Patients should be warned about withdrawal reactions that can occur with continued use of alprazolam and the potential for a protracted withdrawal syndrome. They should be advised that discontinuation or dosage reduction may require a slow taper.

Patients should be advised not to drive or operate heavy machinery while taking alprazolam due to its CNS depressant effects. They should also avoid alcohol or other CNS depressants.

Patients with depression should be monitored for signs of suicidality or worsening depression. They should be advised to inform their healthcare provider of all medicines they take, including prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, and herbal supplements.

Pregnant women should be advised that use of alprazolam late in pregnancy can result in sedation and/or withdrawal symptoms in newborns. They should be informed about the pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to alprazolam during pregnancy.

Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with alprazolam. For the most recent prescribing information, patients should visit www.sandoz.com.

For sedation, 12.5 to 25 mg can be given to children and 25 to 50 mg to adults at bedtime. Before surgery, 12.5 to 25 mg can be given to children and 50 mg to adults to relieve anxiety and induce sleep. After surgery, 12.5 to 25 mg can be given to children and 25 to 50 mg to adults for sedation and pain relief. 
contraindications: CONTRAINDICATIONS Promethazine hydrochloride tablets, USP are contraindicated for use in pediatric patients less than two years of age. Promethazine hydrochloride tablets, USP are contraindicated in comatose states, and in individuals known to be hypersensitive or to have had an idiosyncratic reaction to promethazine or to other phenothiazines. Antihistamines are contraindicated for use in the treatment of lower respiratory tract symptoms including asthma. 
adverse reactions: The drug in question can cause a variety of adverse reactions. The most common effect on the central nervous system is drowsiness, but it can also cause sedation, blurred vision, dizziness, confusion, disorientation, and various other symptoms. Hallucinations have been reported as well. Cardiovascular effects can include changes in blood pressure and heart rate, as well as faintness. Dermatologic reactions can include dermatitis, photosensitivity, and urticaria. Hematologic reactions can include leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and agranulocytosis. Gastrointestinal reactions can include dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice. Respiratory reactions can include asthma, nasal stuffiness, and potentially fatal respiratory depression and apnea. Other reactions can include angioneurotic edema and potentially fatal neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Hyperexcitability and abnormal movements have been reported after a single dose. If these occur, discontinuation of the drug and use of other drugs should be considered. Respiratory depression, nightmares, delirium, and agitated behavior have also been reported in some patients. 
pregnancy: Promethazine hydrochloride, a drug classified under Pregnancy Category C, has not shown teratogenic (harmful to fetus) effects in rat studies at certain doses. However, higher daily doses have resulted in fetal mortality in rats. No specific studies have been conducted on the drug's impact on childbirth, lactation, and neonatal development, but preliminary studies suggest no effect. The drug's effects in rodents do not necessarily reflect its effects in humans. There are no comprehensive studies on the use of promethazine hydrochloride tablets in pregnant women. Therefore, they should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the fetus. Additionally, administering these tablets to a pregnant woman close to delivery may inhibit platelet aggregation in the newborn. 
nursing mothers: Nursing Mothers It is not known whether promethazine hydrochloride is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from promethazine hydrochloride tablets, USP a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 
precautions: Promethazine hydrochloride tablets should be used with caution in patients with certain conditions such as narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, and liver function impairment. The drug may cause drowsiness and impair mental and physical abilities, potentially affecting tasks like driving or operating machinery. It can also interact with other central-nervous-system depressants, potentially enhancing impairment. 

Patients should avoid prolonged sun exposure and report any involuntary muscle movements. The drug may also affect certain laboratory tests, including pregnancy tests and glucose tolerance tests. 

There is no conclusive data on the drug's potential carcinogenic effects, mutagenicity, or impairment of fertility. It should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus. 

The drug may inhibit platelet aggregation in newborns if administered to a pregnant woman within two weeks of delivery. It is unknown whether the drug is excreted in human milk, so a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or the drug. 

The drug is not recommended for use in children under two years of age and should be used with caution in children over two years of age. Elderly patients should start with low doses due to the potential for confusion and over-sedation. 
information for patients: Information for Patients Promethazine hydrochloride tablets, USP may cause marked drowsiness or impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery. The use of alcohol or other central-nervous-system depressants such as sedatives/hypnotics (including barbiturates), narcotics, narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, tricyclic antidepressants, and tranquilizers, may enhance impairment ( see WARNINGS-CNS Depression and PRECAUTIONS-Drug Interactions ). Pediatric patients should be supervised to avoid potential harm in bike riding or in other hazardous activities. Patients should be advised to report any involuntary muscle movements. Avoid prolonged exposure to the sun.

adverse reactions: The document discusses the adverse reactions and clinical trial experiences related to the drug LUMOXITI, used for treating Hairy Cell Leukemia (HCL). The most common adverse reactions include infusion-related reactions, edema, nausea, fatigue, headache, fever, constipation, anemia, and diarrhea. Laboratory abnormalities such as increased creatinine and ALT, hypoalbuminemia, increased AST, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia were also common. 

The clinical trial involved 80 patients with previously treated HCL. They received LUMOXITI as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes on specific days of each 28-day cycle for a maximum of 6 cycles. The median duration of treatment was 5.7 months. 

Adverse reactions led to the discontinuation of LUMOXITI in 15% of patients, with Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) being the most common reason. The most common reaction causing dose delays or interruptions was fever. 

The document also discusses the potential for immunogenicity with all therapeutic proteins. In the study, 59% of patients tested positive for anti-moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk antibodies (ADA) before any treatment. Patients who tested positive for ADA had decreased systemic moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk concentrations. 
pregnancy: 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action and findings in non-pregnant female animals, LUMOXITI is expected to cause maternal and embryo-fetal toxicity when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ] . There are no available data on LUMOXITI use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. Animal reproduction or developmental toxicity studies have not been conducted with LUMOXITI. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. 
information for patients: Patients should read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide) for LUMOXITI, a medication manufactured by AstraZeneca. They should be aware of the risk of developing capillary leak syndrome and hemolytic uremic syndrome, and report any related symptoms to their healthcare provider immediately.

warnings and cautions: The document provides warnings and precautions for the use of the drug gabapentin. It highlights potential risks such as:

1. Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS): Gabapentin should be discontinued if an alternative cause for the symptoms cannot be established.
2. Anaphylaxis and Angioedema: If these occur, gabapentin should be discontinued and the patient should seek immediate medical care.
3. Driving Impairment; Somnolence/Sedation and Dizziness: Patients should not drive or operate heavy machinery until they have assessed whether gabapentin impairs their ability.
4. Increased seizure frequency: This may occur if gabapentin is abruptly discontinued in patients with seizure disorders.
5. Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Patients should be monitored for suicidal thoughts/behavior.
6. Respiratory Depression: This may occur when gabapentin is used with other central nervous system depressants or in patients with underlying respiratory impairment.
7. Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions in Children 3 to 12 Years of Age: Children should be monitored for such events.
8. Tumorigenic Potential: Gabapentin increased the incidence of pancreatic acinar cell tumors in rats, but the clinical significance of this finding is unknown.
9. Sudden and Unexplained Death in Patients with Epilepsy: There were 8 sudden and unexplained deaths recorded among a cohort of 2203 epilepsy patients treated with gabapentin during premarketing development. 
adverse reactions: The document discusses the adverse reactions associated with a drug, with specific sections detailing reactions in different age groups and conditions. Serious reactions include Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), Anaphylaxis, Angioedema, Somnolence/Sedation, Dizziness, Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus, Suicidal Behavior and Ideation, Respiratory Depression, Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions, and Sudden and Unexplained Death in Patients with Epilepsy. 

Common reactions include dizziness, somnolence, peripheral edema, ataxia, fatigue, nystagmus, viral infection, fever, nausea, vomiting, and hostility. Adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in some cases. 

The document also provides information on how to report suspected adverse reactions and discusses the limitations of clinical trials in predicting adverse reaction rates in the general population. 

Postherpetic neuralgia and epilepsy patients experienced different adverse reactions. In postherpetic neuralgia patients, the most common reactions were dizziness, somnolence, and peripheral edema. In epilepsy patients, reactions varied by age. 

Adverse reactions were also reported postmarketing, including hepatobiliary disorders, elevated creatine kinase, elevated liver function tests, hyponatremia, rhabdomyolysis, movement disorder, psychiatric disorders, reproductive system and breast disorders, and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. Life-threatening or fatal respiratory depression has been reported in patients taking the drug with opioids or other CNS depressants, or in those with underlying respiratory impairment. Abrupt discontinuation of the drug has also been associated with adverse reactions. 
pregnancy: A pregnancy exposure registry monitors the outcomes of pregnancies in women who have taken antiepileptic drugs like gabapentin. Women taking gabapentin during pregnancy are encouraged to register with the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. There is insufficient data on the developmental risks of using gabapentin during pregnancy. Nonclinical studies on animals have shown developmental toxicity when gabapentin was administered to pregnant animals. In the general U.S. population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20% respectively. The risk for the population indicated is unknown. Animal data shows embryofetal toxicity in mice and adverse effects on offspring development in rats when given gabapentin during pregnancy. Increased embryofetal mortality was observed in rabbits. A study showed that gabapentin caused a significant decrease in neuronal synapse formation in mice. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. 
nursing mothers: 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Gabapentin is secreted in human milk following oral administration. The effects on the breastfed infant and on milk production are unknown. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for gabapentin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from gabapentin or from the underlying maternal condition. 
information for patients: This is patient counseling information for the drug gabapentin. Patients should be aware that:

1. Gabapentin can be taken orally with or without food.
2. Before starting gabapentin, patients should be informed that a rash or other signs of hypersensitivity could indicate a serious medical event. They should report any such symptoms to a doctor immediately.
3. If patients develop signs of anaphylaxis or angioedema, they should stop taking gabapentin and seek medical care.
4. Gabapentin may cause dizziness, somnolence, and other symptoms of CNS depression. Patients should avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until they know how gabapentin affects them.
5. Gabapentin, like other AEDs, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Patients should be alert for worsening depression, changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts.
6. Gabapentin may cause respiratory depression, especially in those using other CNS depressants or those with underlying respiratory impairment. Patients should seek medical attention immediately if this occurs.
7. If patients become pregnant or plan to breastfeed, they should inform their doctor. They are also encouraged to enroll in the NAAED Pregnancy Registry, which collects information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy.

substance name: AMPICILLIN SODIUM 
indications and usage: Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is a treatment for infections caused by certain microorganisms. It is effective against skin and skin structure infections, intra-abdominal infections, and gynecological infections caused by beta-lactamase producing strains of various bacteria. The drug should be used only for the conditions listed, and is also effective against infections caused by ampicillin-susceptible organisms. Before treatment, appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed to identify the organisms causing infection. Therapy may be started before these results are obtained if there is reason to believe the infection may involve any of the listed organisms. Once results are known, therapy should be adjusted if necessary. The drug should only be used to treat infections proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria, to prevent the development of drug-resistant bacteria. If culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered when choosing or modifying therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may guide the selection of therapy. 
dosage and administration: Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection, USP can be administered via IV or IM routes. For IV, the dose can be given slowly over 10-15 minutes or as an infusion over 15-30 minutes. For IM, it should be a deep injection. The recommended adult dosage is 1.5 g to 3 g every six hours, with the total dose of sulbactam not exceeding 4 grams per day. For pediatric patients aged 1 year or older, the recommended daily dose is 300 mg per kg of body weight, given every 6 hours. However, the safety of IM administration in pediatric patients is not established. Pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or more should follow adult dosage recommendations. IV therapy should not exceed 14 days. In patients with impaired renal function, the dosage should be adjusted according to the degree of impairment. The dosage guide is provided in the content for different levels of creatinine clearance. 
contraindications: CONTRAINDICATIONS The use of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is contraindicated in individuals with a history of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis or Stevens-Johnson syndrome) to ampicillin, sulbactam or to other beta-lactam antibacterial drugs (e.g., penicillins and cephalosporins). Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is contraindicated in patients with a previous history of cholestatic jaundice/hepatic dysfunction associated with ampicillin and sulbactam for injection. 
adverse reactions: The injection of Ampicillin and Sulbactam is generally well tolerated in adults. However, some adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials. Local reactions include pain at the injection site and thrombophlebitis. Systemic reactions include diarrhea, rash, itching, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, headache, chest pain, and other less common symptoms. 

In pediatric patients, the adverse events profile is similar to adults, with the addition of atypical lymphocytosis observed in one case. 

Adverse laboratory changes reported during clinical trials include increased liver enzymes, changes in blood cell counts, decreased serum albumin and total proteins, increased BUN and creatinine, and presence of RBC's and hyaline casts in urine. 

Post-marketing experiences have reported additional adverse reactions including blood and lymphatic system disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, general disorders, immune system disorders, nervous system disorders, renal and urinary disorders, respiratory disorders, and skin disorders. 

These reactions are usually reversible upon discontinuation of therapy. Serious and fatal hypersensitivity reactions may occur. To report suspected adverse reactions, contact Meitheal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. or FDA. 
pregnancy: Pregnancy Reproduction studies have been performed in mice, rats, and rabbits at doses up to ten (10) times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to ampicillin and sulbactam for injection. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed (see -PRECAUTIONS-Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions section). 
nursing mothers: Nursing Mothers Low concentrations of ampicillin and sulbactam are excreted in the milk; therefore, caution should be exercised when ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is administered to a nursing woman. 
precautions: Patients with mononucleosis should not be given ampicillin class antibacterials due to the high risk of developing a skin rash. Ampicillin and sulbactam should only be prescribed for bacterial infections, not viral ones, and patients should complete the full course of therapy to prevent bacterial resistance. Diarrhea is a common side effect, and patients should contact their doctor if they develop watery and bloody stools. The drug may interact with probenecid and allopurinol, potentially leading to increased blood levels of ampicillin and sulbactam and an increased incidence of rashes. It should not be mixed with aminoglycosides. High urine concentrations of ampicillin may cause false positive reactions in glucose tests. The drug may also temporarily decrease plasma concentration of certain hormones in pregnant women. Its effects on fertility and during labor and delivery are not fully known. It is excreted in low concentrations in breast milk. The safety and effectiveness of the drug have been established for children over one year old for skin infections, but not for intra-abdominal infections.

substance name: DIVALPROEX SODIUM 
indications and usage: Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablet is an anti-epileptic drug used for treating manic episodes related to bipolar disorder, complex partial seizures, simple and complex absence seizures, and for preventing migraine headaches. It is not recommended for acute treatment of migraines. The drug's effectiveness for long-term use in mania has not been proven in controlled clinical trials, so healthcare providers should regularly reassess its usefulness for individual patients. Due to the risk of decreased IQ, neurodevelopmental disorders, neural tube defects, and other major congenital malformations in the fetus, it should not be used by pregnant women or women planning to become pregnant, unless other medications have failed to control symptoms or are unacceptable. It is also contraindicated in women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception. 
dosage and administration: Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets are taken orally and should not be crushed or chewed. The initial dose for mania is 750 mg daily, which can be increased to achieve the desired therapeutic response. For complex partial seizures, the starting dose is 10 to 15 mg/kg/day, which can be increased weekly until optimal response is achieved. For absence seizures, the starting dose is 15 mg/kg/day, which can be increased weekly until seizures are controlled or side effects limit further increases. For migraines, the starting dose is 250 mg twice daily, which can be increased to a maximum of 1,000 mg/day as needed. 

If a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible unless it's almost time for the next dose. Doubling the next dose if one is skipped is not recommended. 

For long-term treatment of mania, there is no data to support the benefits of divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets. However, the safety of long-term use is supported by data from record reviews involving approximately 360 patients treated for more than 3 months. 

For epilepsy, divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets are indicated as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in complex partial seizures in adults and pediatric patients down to the age of 10 years, and in simple and complex absence seizures. 

For elderly patients, the starting dose should be reduced due to a decrease in unbound clearance of valproate and possibly a greater sensitivity to somnolence. The ultimate therapeutic dose should be achieved on the basis of both tolerability and clinical response. 

Patients who experience G.I. irritation may benefit from administration of the drug with food or by slowly building up the dose from an initial low level. 

Patients stabilized on rufinamide before being prescribed valproate should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to a clinically effective dose.

9. Somnolence in the elderly: The drug can cause drowsiness in elderly patients, and dosage should be increased slowly with regular monitoring.

10. Interaction with Carbapenem Antibiotics: These antibiotics can reduce the effectiveness of the drug, leading to loss of seizure control.

11. Effect on HIV and CMV Viruses Replication: The drug may stimulate the replication of HIV and CMV viruses under certain conditions.

12. Medication Residue in the Stool: There have been rare reports of medication residue in the stool, particularly in patients with shortened GI transit times or diarrhea. 

In all cases, regular monitoring and consultation with a healthcare provider is necessary. 
adverse reactions: The document discusses the adverse reactions to a drug called valproate, used in the treatment of manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder, complex partial seizures, and migraines. The most common side effects (reported in more than 5% of patients) include abdominal pain, blurred vision, memory loss, anorexia, back pain, constipation, depression, diarrhea, dizziness, fever, headache, increased appetite, insomnia, nausea, nervousness, rash, vomiting, weight gain, and weight loss. 

The safety and tolerability of valproate in pediatric patients were found to be similar to those in adults. Serious adverse reactions include hepatic failure, birth defects, decreased IQ following in utero exposure, pancreatitis, hyperammonemic encephalopathy, suicidal behavior and ideation, bleeding and other hematopoietic disorders, hypothermia, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)/multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions. 

In clinical trials, the rates of premature termination due to intolerance were not statistically different between placebo, valproate, and lithium carbonate. Vomiting was the only reaction that was reported by significantly more patients receiving valproate compared to placebo. 

Postmarketing experience has identified additional adverse reactions including changes in hair texture and color, emotional upset, psychosis, aggression, fractures, decreased bone mineral density, irregular menses, weight gain, hearing loss, and allergic reactions. 
pregnancy: The content discusses the risks associated with the use of the antiepileptic drug, divalproex sodium, during pregnancy. There is a registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to this drug. Pregnant women are encouraged to enroll in this registry. 

The drug is contraindicated for use in pregnant women and women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception, especially for the prophylaxis of migraine headaches. For epilepsy or bipolar disorder, it should only be used if other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control. 

The use of this drug during pregnancy increases the risk of congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects, and other body system malformations. It may also result in hearing impairment or hearing loss in the baby. The risk of major structural abnormalities is greatest during the first trimester. 

Children exposed to this drug in utero have lower IQ scores and a higher risk of neurodevelopmental disorders compared to children exposed to either another antiepileptic drug in utero or to no antiepileptic drugs in utero. 

Pregnant women taking this drug may develop hepatic failure or clotting abnormalities, which may result in hemorrhagic complications in the neonate, including death. 

Folic acid supplementation prior to conception and during the first trimester of pregnancy is recommended for patients using this drug, although it is not known whether this reduces the risk of neural tube defects or decreased IQ in the offspring. 

The use of this drug during pregnancy should be carefully considered and monitored due to the associated risks. 
nursing mothers: 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception while taking valproate [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 ), and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . This is especially important when valproate use is considered for a condition not usually associated with permanent injury or death such as prophylaxis of migraine headaches [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Infertility There have been reports of male infertility coincident with valproate therapy [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.4 )] . In animal studies, oral administration of valproate at clinically relevant doses resulted in adverse reproductive effects in males [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 
information for patients: This is a patient counseling information guide for a medication called valproate. It advises patients to be aware of potential side effects such as hepatotoxicity and pancreatitis, which can cause symptoms like nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and anorexia. It also warns of the risk of birth defects and decreased IQ in children if the drug is used during pregnancy. Women are advised to use effective contraception while taking valproate and to discuss pregnancy planning with their doctor. 

The guide also warns of the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior, hyperammonemic encephalopathy, CNS depression, and multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions. Patients are advised to report any concerning symptoms to their healthcare provider immediately. 

The medication may cause drowsiness, especially when combined with other CNS depressants like alcohol, so patients are advised not to engage in hazardous activities until they know how the drug affects them. 

Patients are also advised to report if they notice medication residue in their stool. The medication is manufactured by Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Lupin Limited. 
substance name: ALPRAZOLAM 
indications and usage: 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Alprazolam tablets are indicated for the: • acute treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in adults. • treatment of panic disorder (PD), with or without agoraphobia in adults. Alprazolam tablets are a benzodiazepine indicated for the: • Acute treatment of generalized anxiety disorder in adults. ( 1 ) • Treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults. ( 1 ) 
dosage and administration: The document provides dosage and administration guidelines for alprazolam, a medication used to treat generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and panic disorder (PD). 

For GAD, the starting dosage is 0.25 mg to 0.5 mg three times daily, which can be increased every 3 to 4 days to a maximum of 4 mg daily. The lowest effective dose should be used and the need for continued treatment should be frequently assessed.

For PD, the starting dosage is 0.5 mg three times daily, which can be increased every 3 to 4 days by no more than 1 mg per day. For patients receiving doses greater than 4 mg per day, periodic reassessment and consideration of dosage reduction is advised.

When tapering off alprazolam, the dosage should be decreased by no more than 0.5 mg every 3 days. If withdrawal reactions occur, the taper may need to be paused or the dosage increased to the previous level, then decreased more slowly.

For geriatric patients and those with hepatic impairment, the starting dosage is 0.25 mg, given 2 or 3 times daily, which can be gradually increased if needed and tolerated. If adverse reactions occur, the dosage may be reduced.

When alprazolam is used with ritonavir, the dosage should be reduced to half of the recommended dosage and then increased to the target dose after 10 to 14 days. Alprazolam is contraindicated with concomitant use of all strong CYP3A inhibitors, except ritonavir. 
dosage forms and strengths: 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Alprazolam tablets are available as: • 0.25 mg: white, oval, debossed “GG 256” on one side and scored on the reverse side • 0.5 mg: peach, oval, debossed “GG 257” on one side and scored on the reverse side • 1 mg: blue, oval, debossed “GG 258” on one side and scored on the reverse side • 2 mg: white, rectangular, multi-scored, debossed “GG 249” on one side and plain on the reverse side Tablets: 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, and 2 mg ( 3 ) 
contraindications: 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Alprazolam is contraindicated in patients: • with known hypersensitivity to alprazolam or other benzodiazepines. Angioedema has been reported [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . • taking strong cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole), except ritonavir [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] • Known hypersensitivity to alprazolam or other benzodiazepines. ( 4 ) • Concomitant use with strong cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) inhibitors, except ritonavir. ( 4 , 5.5 , 7.1 ) 
warnings and cautions: The content provides warnings and precautions for the use of alprazolam, a medication often used to treat anxiety and panic disorders. Key points include:

1. Alprazolam can impair driving and operating machinery. Patients should avoid alcohol and other central nervous system depressants while on this medication.
2. Patients with depression should be closely monitored while on alprazolam. The least number of tablets should be prescribed to avoid intentional overdosage.
3. Alprazolam use during pregnancy can lead to neonatal sedation and withdrawal syndrome.
4. The combined use of alprazolam and opioids can lead to severe sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and even death. If these drugs are prescribed together, the lowest effective dosages should be used.
5. Alprazolam can lead to abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can result in overdose or death. Patients should be assessed for these risks before and during treatment.
6. Discontinuing alprazolam abruptly or reducing the dosage rapidly can lead to withdrawal reactions, some of which can be life-threatening.
7. Alprazolam can interact with drugs that inhibit its metabolism, potentially affecting its clearance from the body.
8. Alprazolam may worsen depression and has been associated with episodes of hypomania and mania.
9. Late pregnancy use of alprazolam can result in neonatal sedation and withdrawal symptoms.
10. Patients with impaired respiratory function should be closely monitored while on alprazolam, as there have been reports of death in such patients shortly after starting the medication. 
adverse reactions: The document discusses the adverse reactions associated with the use of a drug, presumably alprazolam. These reactions are categorized into those identified during clinical trials and those reported post-approval. 

In clinical trials, common adverse reactions for generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder included impaired coordination, hypotension, dysarthria, and increased libido. Other reactions were also reported, such as drowsiness, light-headedness, dizziness, dry mouth, increased salivation, hypotension, dermatitis/allergy, and various other symptoms. 

In postmarketing experience, adverse reactions included hyperprolactinemia, peripheral edema, hepatitis, hepatic failure, liver enzyme elevations, hypomania, mania, gynecomastia, galactorrhea, photosensitivity reaction, angioedema, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. 

The document also mentions risks associated with concomitant use with opioids, abuse, misuse, addiction, dependence and withdrawal reactions, effects on driving and operating machinery, patients with depression, neonatal sedation and withdrawal syndrome, and risks in patients with impaired respiratory function. 

Adverse reactions were also reported as reasons for discontinuation of treatment, including insomnia, light-headedness, abnormal involuntary movement, headache, muscular twitching, impaired coordination, muscle tone disorders, weakness, and various other symptoms. 

The document advises that alprazolam should be discontinued if any of these adverse events occur. It also notes that patients with certain conditions, such as borderline personality disorder, a history of violent or aggressive behavior, or alcohol or substance abuse, may be at higher risk for adverse events. 
pregnancy: There is a registry that tracks pregnancy outcomes in women who have been exposed to psychiatric medications, including alprazolam. Healthcare providers are urged to register patients in this registry. Babies born to mothers who used benzodiazepines late in pregnancy may experience symptoms of sedation and/or withdrawal. However, available data does not clearly link benzodiazepines to major birth defects. All pregnancies carry a risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the general U.S. population, the estimated risk of major birth defects is 2% to 4% and miscarriage is 15% to 20%. Benzodiazepines can cross the placenta and may cause respiratory depression, hypotonia, and sedation in newborns. Newborns exposed to alprazolam during pregnancy should be monitored for these symptoms and for signs of withdrawal. Despite early studies suggesting an increased risk of congenital malformations with certain benzodiazepines, recent studies have not confirmed these findings. 
storage and handling: Store at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature]. Dispense contents in a tight, light-resistant container as defined in the USP with a child-resistant closure. KEEP OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN. 
information for patients: Patients should be advised to read the FDA-approved patient labeling. They should be warned about the risks of using alprazolam with opioids, including potentially fatal respiratory depression and sedation. Patients should not drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of the drug combination are known. 

Patients should be informed about the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction associated with alprazolam, even at recommended dosages. They should be educated about the signs and symptoms of benzodiazepine abuse and addiction, and advised to seek medical help if these symptoms develop.

Patients should be warned about withdrawal reactions that can occur with continued use of alprazolam and the potential for a protracted withdrawal syndrome. They should be advised that discontinuation or dosage reduction may require a slow taper.

Patients should be advised not to drive or operate heavy machinery while taking alprazolam due to its CNS depressant effects. They should also avoid alcohol or other CNS depressants.

Patients with depression should be monitored for signs of suicidality or worsening depression. They should be advised to inform their healthcare provider of all medicines they take, including prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, and herbal supplements.

Pregnant women should be advised that use of alprazolam late in pregnancy can result in sedation and/or withdrawal symptoms in newborns. They should be informed about the pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to alprazolam during pregnancy.

Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with alprazolam. For the most recent prescribing information, patients should visit www.sandoz.com.

For nausea and vomiting, the average effective dose is 25 mg, but it should not be used if the cause of vomiting is unknown. The dose can be repeated every 4 to 6 hours if necessary. For sedation, 12.5 to 25 mg can be given to children and 25 to 50 mg to adults at bedtime. Before surgery, 12.5 to 25 mg can be given to children and 50 mg to adults to relieve anxiety and induce sleep. After surgery, 12.5 to 25 mg can be given to children and 25 to 50 mg to adults for sedation and pain relief. 
contraindications: CONTRAINDICATIONS Promethazine hydrochloride tablets, USP are contraindicated for use in pediatric patients less than two years of age. Promethazine hydrochloride tablets, USP are contraindicated in comatose states, and in individuals known to be hypersensitive or to have had an idiosyncratic reaction to promethazine or to other phenothiazines. Antihistamines are contraindicated for use in the treatment of lower respiratory tract symptoms including asthma. 
adverse reactions: The drug in question can cause a variety of adverse reactions. The most common effect on the central nervous system is drowsiness, but it can also cause sedation, blurred vision, dizziness, confusion, disorientation, and various other symptoms. Hallucinations have been reported as well. Cardiovascular effects can include changes in blood pressure and heart rate, as well as faintness. Dermatologic reactions can include dermatitis, photosensitivity, and urticaria. Hematologic reactions can include leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and agranulocytosis. Gastrointestinal reactions can include dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice. Respiratory reactions can include asthma, nasal stuffiness, and potentially fatal respiratory depression and apnea. Other reactions can include angioneurotic edema and potentially fatal neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Hyperexcitability and abnormal movements have been reported after a single dose. If these occur, discontinuation of the drug and use of other drugs should be considered. Respiratory depression, nightmares, delirium, and agitated behavior have also been reported in some patients. 
pregnancy: Promethazine hydrochloride, a drug classified under Pregnancy Category C, has not shown teratogenic (harmful to fetus) effects in rat studies at certain doses. However, higher daily doses have resulted in fetal mortality in rats. No specific studies have been conducted on the drug's impact on childbirth, lactation, and neonatal development, but preliminary studies suggest no effect. The drug's effects in rodents do not necessarily reflect its effects in humans. There are no comprehensive studies on the use of promethazine hydrochloride tablets in pregnant women. Therefore, they should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the fetus. Additionally, administering these tablets to a pregnant woman close to delivery may inhibit platelet aggregation in the newborn. 
nursing mothers: Nursing Mothers It is not known whether promethazine hydrochloride is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from promethazine hydrochloride tablets, USP a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 
precautions: Promethazine hydrochloride tablets should be used with caution in patients with certain conditions such as narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, and liver function impairment. The drug may cause drowsiness and impair mental and physical abilities, potentially affecting tasks like driving or operating machinery. It can also interact with other central-nervous-system depressants, potentially enhancing impairment. 

Patients should avoid prolonged sun exposure and report any involuntary muscle movements. The drug may also affect certain laboratory tests, including pregnancy tests and glucose tolerance tests. 

There is no conclusive data on the drug's potential carcinogenic effects, mutagenicity, or impairment of fertility. It should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus. 

The drug may inhibit platelet aggregation in newborns if administered to a pregnant woman within two weeks of delivery. It is unknown whether the drug is excreted in human milk, so a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or the drug. 

The drug is not recommended for use in children under two years of age and should be used with caution in children over two years of age. Elderly patients should start with low doses due to the potential for confusion and over-sedation. 
information for patients: Information for Patients Promethazine hydrochloride tablets, USP may cause marked drowsiness or impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery. The use of alcohol or other central-nervous-system depressants such as sedatives/hypnotics (including barbiturates), narcotics, narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, tricyclic antidepressants, and tranquilizers, may enhance impairment ( see WARNINGS-CNS Depression and PRECAUTIONS-Drug Interactions ). Pediatric patients should be supervised to avoid potential harm in bike riding or in other hazardous activities. Patients should be advised to report any involuntary muscle movements. Avoid prolonged exposure to the sun.

1. Renal Toxicity: Monitor renal function before each infusion and delay dosing until recovery if necessary. 

2. Infusion Related Reactions: Pre-medicate before each dose and interrupt the infusion if a severe reaction occurs. 

3. Electrolyte Abnormalities: Monitor serum electrolytes before each dose and on Day 8 of each treatment cycle. 

4. Capillary Leak Syndrome (CLS): Monitor patient weight and blood pressure before each infusion and assess for signs and symptoms of CLS. Delay or discontinue treatment if necessary. 

5. Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS): Avoid LUMOXITI in patients with a history of severe thrombotic microangiopathy or HUS. Monitor blood chemistry and complete blood counts before each dose. Discontinue LUMOXITI in patients with HUS. 

6. Renal Toxicity: Monitor renal function before each infusion and delay dosing in patients with Grade ≥ 3 elevations in creatinine. 

7. Infusion Related Reactions: Pre-medicate with antihistamines and antipyretics before each dose. Interrupt the infusion and administer a corticosteroid if a severe reaction occurs. 

8. Electrolyte Abnormalities: Monitor serum electrolytes before each dose and on Day 8 of each treatment cycle. 

In summary, the use of LUMOXITI requires careful monitoring of renal function, electrolyte levels, and patient symptoms to manage potential side effects and reactions. 
adverse reactions: The document discusses the adverse reactions and clinical trial experiences related to the drug LUMOXITI, used for treating Hairy Cell Leukemia (HCL). The most common adverse reactions include infusion-related reactions, edema, nausea, fatigue, headache, fever, constipation, anemia, and diarrhea. Laboratory abnormalities such as increased creatinine and ALT, hypoalbuminemia, increased AST, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia were also common. 

The clinical trial involved 80 patients with previously treated HCL. They received LUMOXITI as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes on specific days of each 28-day cycle for a maximum of 6 cycles. The median duration of treatment was 5.7 months. 

Adverse reactions led to the discontinuation of LUMOXITI in 15% of patients, with Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) being the most common reason. The most common reaction causing dose delays or interruptions was fever. 

The document also discusses the potential for immunogenicity with all therapeutic proteins. In the study, 59% of patients tested positive for anti-moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk antibodies (ADA) before any treatment. Patients who tested positive for ADA had decreased systemic moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk concentrations. 
pregnancy: 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action and findings in non-pregnant female animals, LUMOXITI is expected to cause maternal and embryo-fetal toxicity when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ] . There are no available data on LUMOXITI use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. Animal reproduction or developmental toxicity studies have not been conducted with LUMOXITI. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. 
information for patients: Patients should read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide) for LUMOXITI, a medication manufactured by AstraZeneca. They should be aware of the risk of developing capillary leak syndrome and hemolytic uremic syndrome, and report any related symptoms to their healthcare provider immediately. Patients should also maintain high fluid intake and have frequent blood chemistry checks. LUMOXITI may cause decreased renal function, so any changes in urine output should be reported. Patients should also contact their healthcare provider if they experience symptoms of infusion related reactions or electrolyte abnormalities. The medication is distributed by AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP and manufactured by AstraZeneca AB.

indications and usage: 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Gabapentin is indicated for: • Management of postherpetic neuralgia in adults • Adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures, with and without secondary generalization, in adults and pediatric patients 3 years and older with epilepsy Gabapentin is indicated for: • Postherpetic neuralgia in adults ( 1 ) • Adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures, with and without secondary generalization, in adults and pediatric patients 3 years and older with epilepsy ( 1 ) 
dosage and administration: The document provides dosage and administration guidelines for Gabapentin, a medication used for postherpetic neuralgia and epilepsy with partial onset seizures. 

For postherpetic neuralgia, the initial dosage is a single 300mg dose on Day 1, 600mg/day on Day 2, and 900mg/day on Day 3. The dosage can be increased up to 1800mg/day if needed for pain relief. 

For epilepsy with partial onset seizures, the starting dose for patients aged 12 and above is 300mg three times a day, which can be increased up to 600mg three times a day. For patients aged 3 to 11, the starting dose ranges from 10 to 15 mg/kg/day, given in three divided doses. The recommended dose for patients aged 3 to 4 is 40 mg/kg/day, and for patients aged 5 to 11, it's 25 to 35 mg/kg/day. 

The dosage should be adjusted for patients with reduced renal function. The document provides a table to determine the dosage based on renal function and creatinine clearance. 

For elderly patients, dosage should be adjusted based on creatinine clearance values due to the likelihood of decreased renal function. 

Gabapentin can be administered orally with or without food, and the capsules should be swallowed whole with water. If the dosage is reduced, discontinued, or substituted, it should be done gradually over a minimum of 1 week.

contraindications: 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Gabapentin is contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the drug or its ingredients. Known hypersensitivity to gabapentin or its ingredients 
warnings and cautions: The document provides warnings and precautions for the use of the drug gabapentin. It highlights potential risks such as Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), anaphylaxis, angioedema, driving impairment, increased seizure frequency, suicidal behavior and ideation, respiratory depression, and neuropsychiatric adverse reactions. 

DRESS, a potentially fatal reaction, may present with fever, rash, and/or lymphadenopathy, along with other organ system involvement. If such symptoms are present, gabapentin should be discontinued unless an alternative cause can be established. 

Anaphylaxis and angioedema can occur at any time during treatment. If these symptoms occur, patients should discontinue gabapentin and seek immediate medical care. 

Gabapentin may impair driving and operating heavy machinery. Patients should not drive until they have gained sufficient experience to assess whether their ability to drive is impaired. 

Abrupt discontinuation of gabapentin may increase seizure frequency in patients with seizure disorders. 

Gabapentin may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. Patients should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. 

Respiratory depression may occur when gabapentin is used with other CNS depressants, including opioids, or in patients with underlying respiratory impairment. 

In children aged 3 to 12, gabapentin use may lead to CNS related adverse reactions such as emotional lability, hostility, thought disorder, and hyperkinesia. 

The document also mentions the potential tumorigenic potential of gabapentin and the occurrence of sudden and unexplained deaths in patients with epilepsy during the premarketing development of the drug. 
adverse reactions: The document discusses the adverse reactions associated with a drug, with specific sections detailing reactions in adults and children.

substance name: AMPICILLIN SODIUM 
indications and usage: Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is a treatment for infections caused by certain microorganisms. It is effective against skin and skin structure infections, intra-abdominal infections, and gynecological infections caused by beta-lactamase producing strains of various bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Bacteroides fragilis, Enterobacter spp., and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. 

The drug is also effective against infections caused by ampicillin-susceptible organisms. Therefore, mixed infections caused by both ampicillin-susceptible and beta-lactamase producing organisms should not require additional antibacterial treatment. 

Before treatment, appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed to identify the organisms causing infection and to determine their susceptibility to the drug. Therapy may be started before obtaining these results if there is reason to believe the infection may involve any of the beta-lactamase producing organisms listed above. 

The drug should only be used to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria to prevent the development of drug-resistant bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. 
dosage and administration: Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection, USP can be administered via IV or IM routes. For IV, the dose can be given slowly over 10-15 minutes or as an infusion over 15-30 minutes. For IM, it should be a deep injection. The recommended adult dosage is 1.5 g to 3 g every six hours, with the total sulbactam dose not exceeding 4 grams per day. For pediatric patients aged 1 year or older, the recommended daily dose is 300 mg per kg of body weight, given via IV infusion every 6 hours. However, the safety of IM injection in pediatric patients is not established. Pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or more should follow adult dosage recommendations. IV therapy should not exceed 14 days. In patients with impaired renal function, the dosage should be adjusted according to the patient's renal function. The dosage guide for patients with renal impairment is provided in Table 3. The serum creatinine value can be used to calculate creatinine clearance using a formula based on the patient's sex, weight, and age. 
contraindications: CONTRAINDICATIONS The use of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is contraindicated in individuals with a history of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis or Stevens-Johnson syndrome) to ampicillin, sulbactam or to other beta-lactam antibacterial drugs (e.g., penicillins and cephalosporins). Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is contraindicated in patients with a previous history of cholestatic jaundice/hepatic dysfunction associated with ampicillin and sulbactam for injection. 
adverse reactions: Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is generally well tolerated in adults and children. However, some adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials. Local reactions include pain at the injection site and thrombophlebitis. Systemic reactions include diarrhea, rash, itching, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, headache, chest pain, and other less common symptoms. In children, atypical lymphocytosis has been observed. Adverse laboratory changes include increased liver enzymes, changes in blood cell counts, decreased serum albumin and total proteins, increased BUN and creatinine, and presence of RBC's and hyaline casts in urine. Post-marketing experiences have reported blood and lymphatic system disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, general disorders, immune system disorders, nervous system disorders, renal and urinary disorders, respiratory disorders, and skin disorders. These reactions are usually reversible upon discontinuation of therapy. To report suspected adverse reactions, contact Meitheal Pharmaceuticals or FDA. 
pregnancy: Pregnancy Reproduction studies have been performed in mice, rats, and rabbits at doses up to ten (10) times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to ampicillin and sulbactam for injection. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed (see -PRECAUTIONS-Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions section). 
nursing mothers: Nursing Mothers Low concentrations of ampicillin and sulbactam are excreted in the milk; therefore, caution should be exercised when ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is administered to a nursing woman. 
precautions: The document discusses precautions and guidelines for the use of ampicillin and sulbactam, a type of antibacterial medication. Patients with mononucleosis should not take this medication due to the high risk of developing a skin rash. During treatment, the possibility of superinfections with mycotic or bacterial pathogens should be considered. If such infections occur, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy should be initiated. 

The medication should only be prescribed for bacterial infections, not viral ones, and should be taken as directed to prevent bacterial resistance. Side effects can include diarrhea and, in some cases, watery and bloody stools. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician immediately. 

The document also discusses drug interactions. Probenecid can increase blood levels of ampicillin and sulbactam, and concurrent use of allopurinol can increase the incidence of rashes. The medication can also interfere with certain urine glucose tests, leading to false positive results. 

In terms of use during pregnancy, studies in animals have not shown harm to the fetus, but there are no adequate studies in pregnant women. The drug should only be used during pregnancy if necessary. The drug can also affect labor and delivery, as studies in guinea pigs have shown it can decrease uterine tone and contractions. 

The medication is excreted in low concentrations in breast milk, so caution is advised when administering to nursing women. The safety and effectiveness of the drug have been established for pediatric patients one year of age and older for skin and skin structure infections, but not for intra-abdominal infections. 
storage and handling: Storage Conditions Prior to reconstitution store at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F); excursions permitted between 15° and 30°C (59° and 86°F).

Gujarat, India 390010 Revised: January 2023 
information for patients: Patients should be informed that antibiotics like ampicillin and sulbactam are only effective against bacterial infections, not viral ones like the common cold. Even if they start feeling better, patients must follow the prescribed dosage and complete the full course of treatment. Failure to do so can reduce the treatment's effectiveness and may lead to bacteria developing resistance, making future treatments with this or other antibiotics ineffective. Antibiotics can cause diarrhea, which usually stops once the medication is discontinued. However, some patients may experience watery and bloody stools, possibly with stomach cramps and fever, even months after finishing the treatment. If this happens, they should consult their doctor immediately.

If such infections occur, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy should be initiated. 

The medication should only be prescribed for bacterial infections, not viral ones, and should be taken as directed to prevent bacterial resistance. Side effects can include diarrhea and, in some cases, watery and bloody stools. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician immediately. 

The document also discusses drug interactions. Probenecid can increase blood levels of ampicillin and sulbactam, and concurrent use of allopurinol can increase the incidence of rashes. The medication can also interfere with certain urine glucose tests, leading to false positive results. 

In terms of use during pregnancy, studies in animals have not shown harm to the fetus, but there are no adequate studies in pregnant women. The drug should only be used during pregnancy if necessary. The drug can also affect labor and delivery, as studies in guinea pigs have shown it can decrease uterine tone and contractions. 

The medication is excreted in low concentrations in breast milk, so caution is advised when administering to nursing women. The safety and effectiveness of the drug have been established for pediatric patients one year of age and older for skin and skin structure infections, but not for intra-abdominal infections.

information for patients: Patients should be informed that antibiotics like ampicillin and sulbactam are only effective against bacterial infections, not viral ones like the common cold. Even if they start feeling better, patients must follow the prescribed dosage and complete the full course of treatment. Failure to do so can reduce the treatment's effectiveness and may lead to bacteria developing resistance, making future treatments with this or other antibiotics ineffective. Antibiotics can cause diarrhea, which usually stops once the medication is discontinued. However, some patients may experience watery and bloody stools, possibly with stomach cramps and fever, even months after finishing the treatment. If this happens, they should consult their doctor immediately.
